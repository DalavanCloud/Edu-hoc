#39#25349# the horizons of
##40#75654#humanity blah, blah#
#41#82359#, blah. The Ares 1 #
#42#85141#crew did their thin#
#43#36018#g and came back her#
#44#38275#oes. They got the p#
#45#7832#arades and fame and#
#46#32462# love of the world.#
#47#38129#Ares 2 did the same#
#48#57787# thing, in a differ#
#49#79521#ent location on Mar#
#50#99693#s. They got a firm #
#51#85629#handshake and a hot#
#52#70563# cup of coffee when#
#53#20507# they got home.
##54#58351#Ares 3. Wel. That w#
#55#87021#as my mission. Wel,#
#56#1246# not mine per se. C#
#57#54635#ommander Lewis was #
#58#56712#in charge. I was ju#
#59#63788#st one of her crew.#
#60#38672#was the very lowest#
#61#14955# ranked member of t#
#62#24765#he crew. I would on#

#64#85930#‚Äù of the mission #
#65#55342#if I were the only #

##67#68824#What do you know? I#

##69#75012#I wonder if this lo#

#71#20788#before the rest of #

#75#15817# al right. Wel, guy#
#76#56341#s, if you‚Äôre read#
#77#41293#ing this: It wasn‚Ä#
#78#16560#ôt your fault. You #
#79#80011#did what you had to#
#80#11186# do. In your positi#
#81#20818#on I would have don#
#82#9029#e the same thing. I#
#83#19638# don‚Äôt blame you,#
#84#11678# and I‚Äôm glad you#
#85#24243#I guess I should ex#
#86#56684#plain how Mars miss#
#87#97764#ions work, for any #
#88#53158#layman who may be r#
#89#25280#eading this. We got#
#90#70715# to earth orbit the#
#91#22098#through an ordinary#
#92#4574# ship to Hermes. Al#
#93#24515# the Ares missions #
#94#66222#use Hermes to get t#
#95#39977#o and from Mars. It#
#96#39879#‚Äôs realy big and #
#97#99363#cost a lot so NASA #
#98#66790#Once we got to Herm#
#99#2721#es, four additional#
#100#30005# unmanned missions #
#101#90742#brought us fuel and#
#102#88347# supplies while we #
#103#7491#prepared for our tr#
#104#90852#everything was a go#
#105#42501#, we set out for Ma#
#106#90221#rs. But not very fa#
#107#4975#st. Gone are the da#
#108#60694#ys of heavy chemica#
#109#32281#l fuel burns and tr#
#110#34016#ans-Mars injection#
#111#4325#Hermes is powered b#
#112#33055#y ion engines. They#
#113#55508# throw Argon out th#
#114#55394#e back of the ship #
#115#11018#realy fast to get a#
#116#85193# tiny amount of acc#
#117#88441#eleration. The thin#
#118#22971#is, it doesn't take#
#119#47750# much reactant mass#
#120#45056#, so a little Argon#
#121#8094# (and a nuclear rea#
#122#71203#ctor to power thing#
#123#62776#s) let us accelerat#
#124#58912#e constantly the wh#
#125#75166#ole way there. You'#
#126#67316#d be amazed at how #
#127#15880#fast you can get go#
#128#15883#ing with a tiny acc#
#129#32921#eleration over a lo#
#130#29618#I could regale you #
#131#73029#with tales of how w#
#132#78403#e had great fun on #
#133#21056#the trip, but I won#
#134#90107#‚Äôt. We did have f#
#135#31549#un, but I don‚Äôt f#
#136#91762#eel like reliving i#
#137#3144#Suffice it to say w#
#138#69065#e got to Mars 124 d#
#139#11214#ays later without s#
#140#77329#trangling each othe#
#141#53609#From there, we took#
#142#98575# the MDV (Mars Desc#
#143#61369#ent Vehicle) to the#
#144#57231# surface. The MDV i#
#145#2089#s basicaly a big ca#
#146#70933#n with some light t#
#147#34365#parachutes attached#
#148#85645#. Its sole purpose #
#149#50711#is to get six human#
#150#56932#s from Mars orbit t#
#151#43619#o the surface witho#
#152#38256#ut kiling any of th#
#153#28011#And now we come to #
#154#45387#the real trick of M#
#155#68002#ars exploration: Ha#
#156#58310#ving al our shit th#
#157#83714#ere in advance.
##158#7454#A total of 14 unman#
#159#71345#ned missions deposi#
#160#72078#ted everything we w#
#161#67886#ould need for surfa#
#162#97608#ce operations. They#
#163#8701# tried their best t#
#164#6730#o land al the suppl#
#165#91709#vessels in the same#
#166#74377# general area, and #
#167#45061#did a reasonably go#
#168#14795#od job. Supplies ar#
#169#36307#en‚Äôt nearly so fr#
#170#45002#agile as humans and#
#171#99251# can hit the ground#
#172#58626# realy hard. But th#
#173#60199#ey tended to bounce#
#174#60753# around a lot.
##175#47117#Naturaly, they didn#
#176#54034#‚Äôt send us to Mar#
#177#8548#s until they‚Äôd co#
#178#66311#nfirmed al the supp#
#179#51248#lies had made it to#
#180#9365# the surface and th#
#181#53056#eir containers were#
#182#94638#breached. Start to #
#183#12729#finish, including s#
#184#87541#upply missions, a M#
#185#85968#ars mission takes a#
#186#86050#bout 3 years. In fa#
#187#35857#ct, there were Ares#
#188#888# 3 supplies en rout#
#189#43460#e to Mars while the#
#190#60304# Ares 2 crew were o#
#191#27178#n their way home.
##192#38285#The most important #
#193#82332#piece of the advanc#
#194#85679#e supplies, of cour#
#195#77638#se, was the MAV. Th#
#196#9242#e ‚ÄúMars Ascent Ve#
#197#11491#hicle.‚Äù That was #
#198#45163#how we would get
##199#29665#back to Hermes afte#
#200#5961#r surface operation#
#201#81600#s were complete. Th#
#202#49908#e MAV was soft-land#
#203#69392#ed (as opposed to t#
#204#46217#he baloon bounce-fe#
#205#45143#supplies had). Of c#
#206#19782#ourse, it was in co#
#207#53563#nstant communicatio#
#208#40751#n with Houston, and#
#209#79015# if there were any #
#210#2180#problems with it, w#
#211#54178#e would pass by Mar#
#212#20051#and go back to Eart#
#213#31654#h without ever land#
#214#6242#The MAV is pretty c#
#215#30623#ool. Turns out, thr#
#216#26009#ough a neat set of #
#217#36919#chemical reactions #
#218#62385#with the Martian at#
#219#26715#mosphere, for every#
#220#35515#hydrogen you bring #
#221#47828#to Mars, you can ma#
#222#60531#ke 13 kilograms of #
#223#29716#fuel. It‚Äôs a slow#
#224#53639# process, though. I#
#225#60416#t takes 24 months t#
#226#98089#o fil the tank. Tha#
#227#83594#t‚Äôs why they sent#
#228#96616# it long before we #
#229#99707#You can imagine how#
#230#9273# disappointed I was#
#231#31414# when I discovered #
#232#91610#the MAV was gone.
##233#11200#It was a ridiculous#
#234#7348# sequence of events#
#235#95301# that led to me alm#
#236#42477#ost dying. Then an #
#237#14513#even more ridiculou#
#238#60873#s sequence that led#
#239#53346# to me surviving.
##240#85666#The mission is desi#
#241#3036#gned to handle sand#
#242#44709#storm gusts up to 1#
#243#18248#50 km/hr. So Housto#
#244#34584#n got understandabl#
#245#44184#y nervous when we g#
#246#97342#with 175 km/hr wind#
#247#95491#s. We al got in our#
#248#76636# suits and huddled #
#249#59299#in the middle of th#
#250#93663#e Hab, just in case#
#251#43201# it lost pressure. #
#252#14082#But the Hab wasn‚Äô#
#253#88205#t the problem.
##254#51000#The MAV is a spaces#
#255#22172#hip. It has a lot o#
#256#55314#f delicate parts. I#
#257#36774#t can put up with s#
#258#44543#torms to a certain #
#259#57701#extent but it can‚Ä#
#260#5682#ôt just get sandbla#
#261#39336#forever. After an h#
#262#10188#our and a half of s#
#263#8329#ustained wind, NASA#
#264#90576# gave the order to #
#265#87162#abort. Nobody wante#
#266#38582#d to stop a month-l#
#267#69436#ong mission after
##268#20781#only six days but i#
#269#76676#f the MAV took any #
#270#15546#more punishment we‚#
#271#24800#Äôd al get stranded#
#272#56760#We had to go out in#
#273#3588# the storm to get f#
#274#65653#rom the Hab to the #
#275#96783#MAV. That was going#
#276#79526# to be risky, but w#
#277#7064#hat choice did we h#
#278#3652#Everyone made it bu#
#279#9244#Our main communicat#
#280#99375#ions dish, which re#
#281#11171#layed signals from #
#282#59473#the Hab to Hermes, #
#283#39677#acted like a parach#
#284#54602#ute, getting torn f#
#285#68388#rom its foundation#
#286#31553#and carried with th#
#287#73712#e torrent. Along th#
#288#87467#e way, it crashed t#
#289#5970#hrough the receptio#
#290#54941#n antenna array. Th#
#291#57160#en one of those lon#
#292#71577#g thin antennae sla#
#293#56887#mmed in to me end f#
#294#79618#irst. It tore throu#
#295#2161#gh my suit like a b#
#296#95241#ulet through butter#
#297#66006# and I felt the wor#
#298#26645#st pain of my life #
#299#84024#as it ripped open m#
#300#22037#y side. I vaguely r#
#301#84099#emember suddenly ha#
#302#78306#ving the wind knock#
#303#58257#ed out of me (puled#
#304#51464# out of me, realy) #
#305#51598#and my ears popping#
#306#99684# painfuly as the pr#
#307#73577#essure of my suit
##308#72982#The last thing I re#
#309#62843#member was seeing J#
#310#29299#ohanssen hopelessly#
#311#80650# reaching out towar#
#312#94690#I awoke to the oxyg#
#313#11958#en alarm in my suit#
#314#52341#. A steady, obnoxio#
#315#35286#us beeping that eve#
#316#81100#ntualy roused me fr#
#317#60673#om a deep and profo#
#318#9900#just fucking die.
##319#57883#The storm had abate#
#320#15861#d; I was face down,#
#321#474# almost totaly buri#
#322#18239#ed in sand. As I gr#
#323#86808#oggily came to, I w#
#324#20868#ondered why I wasn‚#
#325#92879#Äôt more dead.
##326#31008#The antenna had eno#
#327#7412#ugh force to punch #
#328#36538#through the suit an#
#329#96089#d my side, but then#
#330#48057# it got stopped by #
#331#95962#my pelvis. So there#
#332#67112# was only one hole#
#333#88563#in the suit (and a #
#334#91918#hole in me, of cour#
#335#71081#I had been knocked #
#336#72280#back quite a ways a#
#337#39677#nd roled down a ste#
#338#61959#ep hil. Somehow I l#
#339#30798#anded face down, wh#
#340#92489#ich forced the ante#
#341#65698#strongly oblique an#
#342#13558#gle that put a lot #
#343#98252#of torque on the ho#
#344#8833#le in the suit. It #
#345#38976#made a weak seal.
##346#25717#Then, the copious b#
#347#2400#lood from my wound #
#348#7926#trickled down towar#
#349#2546#d the hole. As the #
#350#70114#blood reached the s#
#351#23975#ite of the breach, #
#352#45183#the water in it
##353#65619#quickly evaporated #
#354#6490#from the airflow an#
#355#22673#d low pressure, lea#
#356#20094#ving only a gunky r#
#357#55181#esidue behind. More#
#358#61482# blood came in behi#
#359#101#nd it and was also#
#360#47774#reduced to gunk. Ev#
#361#59910#entualy, the blood #
#362#6720#sealed the gaps aro#
#363#99025#und the hole and re#
#364#85977#duced the leak to s#
#365#30842#omething the suit c#
#366#91551#ould counteract.
##367#14839#The suit did its jo#
#368#34823#b admirably. Seeing#
#369#76581# the drop in pressu#
#370#93227#re, it constantly f#
#371#56645#looded itself with #
#372#3979#air from my nitroge#
#373#79677#n tank to equalize.#
#374#81611# Once the leak beca#
#375#68481#me manageable, it o#
#376#35209#nly had to trickle #
#377#51933#new air in slowly t#
#378#7053#he relieve the air #
#379#72928#After a while, the #
#380#85233#CO2 (carbon dioxide#
#381#65474#) absorbers in the #
#382#74940#suit were expended.#
#383#46224# That‚Äôs realy the#
#384#77123# limiting factor to#
#385#67429# life support. Not #
#386#38412#amount of oxygen yo#
#387#23#u bring with you, b#
#388#68604#ut the amount of CO#
#389#24205#2 you can remove. I#
#390#75832#n the Hab, we had t#
#391#12304#he Oxygenator, a la#
#392#53781#equipment that coul#
#393#85674#d break CO2 apart a#
#394#31547#nd give the oxygen #
#395#70216#back. But the space#
#396#95077#suits had to be por#
#397#9918#table, so they used#
#398#32356# a simple chemical#
#399#12485#absorption process #
#400#95299#with expendable fil#
#401#12534#ters. I‚Äôd been as#
#402#36692#leep long enough th#
#403#8807#at my filters were #
#404#8611#The suit saw this p#
#405#88215#roblem and moved in#
#406#58402# to an emergency mo#
#407#28188#de the engineers ca#
#408#81109#l ‚Äúbloodletting‚Ä#
#409#89369#ù. Having no way to#
#410#88817# separate out the
##411#62141#CO2, the suit delib#
#412#27981#erately vented air #
#413#86615#to the Martian atmo#
#414#44553#sphere, then back-f#
#415#18873#iled with nitrogen.#
#416#95366# Between the breach#
#417#6269# and the bloodletti#
#418#43966#ng, it quickly ran #
#419#53706#out of nitrogen. Al#
#420#80793# it had left was my#
#421#69724#So it did the only #
#422#58793#thing it could to k#
#423#67731#eep me alive. It st#
#424#28126#arted back-filing w#
#425#1614#ith pure oxygen. I #
#426#65742#now risked dying fr#
#427#17189#om oxygen toxicity,#
#428#52167# as the excessively#
#429#86765# high amount of oxy#
#430#19257#gen threatened to b#
#431#69278#urn up my nervous s#
#432#53398#ystem, lungs, and e#
#433#63034#yes. An ironic deat#
#434#39679#h for someone with #
#435#82645#a leaky space suit:#
#436#75014# too much oxygen.
##437#76020#Every step of the w#
#438#82985#ay would have had b#

#440#49907#ts, and warnings. B#
#441#44407#ut it was the high-#
#442#88136#oxygen warning that#
#443#25725#The sheer volume of#
#444#98106# training for a spa#
#445#69728#ce mission is astou#
#446#50833#nding. I spent a we#
#447#48339#ek back on Earth pr#
#448#63609#acticing emergency #
#449#17948#space suit drils. I#
#450#60819#knew what to do.
##451#40113#Carefuly reaching t#
#452#85667#o the side of my he#
#453#2345#lmet, I got the bre#
#454#8940#ach kit. It‚Äôs not#
#455#96116#hing more than a fu#
#456#65842#nnel with a valve a#
#457#90850#t the smal end, and#
#458#34825#unbelievably sticky#
#459#26986# resin on the wide #
#460#61770#end. The idea is yo#
#461#66646#u have the valve op#
#462#68425#en and stick the wi#
#463#33186#de end over a hole.#
#464#59064# The air can escape#
#465#51675#through the valve, #
#466#84432#so it doesn‚Äôt int#
#467#72068#erfere with the res#
#468#40626#in making a good se#
#469#71455#al. Then you close #
#470#48580#the valve and you‚Ä#
#471#24767#ôve sealed the brea#
#472#24448#The tricky part was#
#473#84753# getting the antenn#
#474#64896#a out of the way. I#
#475#24908# puled it out as fa#
#476#24805#st as I could, winc#
#477#71973#ing as the sudden p#
#478#39244#ressure drop dizzie#
#479#25265#d me and made the w#
#480#5350#ound in my side scr#
#481#34543#I got the breach ki#
#482#85081#t over the hole and#
#483#8937# sealed it. It held#
#484#30081#. The suit back-fil#
#485#91627#ed the missing air #
#486#64317#with yet more oxyge#
#487#93084#n. Checking my arm#
#488#64715#readouts, I saw the#
#489#80742# suit was now at 85#
#490#5928#% oxygen. For refer#
#491#88982#ence, Earth‚Äôs atm#
#492#13556#osphere is about 21#
#493#40316#%. I‚Äôd be ok, so #
#494#15171#long as I didn‚Äôt #
#495#83813#spend too much time#
#496#58873#I stumbled up the h#
#497#43008#il back toward the #
#498#41321#Hab. As I crested t#
#499#2367#he rise, I saw some#
#500#48691#thing that made me #
#501#66416#very happy and some#
#502#26740#thing that made
##503#18125#me very sad: The Ha#
#504#86393#b was in-tact (yay!#
#505#53770#) and the MAV was g#
#506#37221#Right that moment I#
#507#55758# knew I was screwed#
#508#36412#. But I didn‚Äôt wa#
#509#36282#nt to just die out #
#510#78007#on the surface. I l#
#511#88457#imped back to the H#
#512#54805#ab and fumbled my
##513#13540#way in to an airloc#
#514#16116#k. As soon as it eq#
#515#232#ualized, I threw of#
#516#26253#Entering the Hab, I#
#517#77815# doffed the suit an#
#518#58852#d got my first good#
#519#77152# look at the injury#
#520#27511#. It would need sti#
#521#70270#tches. Fortunately,#
#522#6379# al of us had been#
#523#31861#trained in basic me#
#524#22103#dical procedures, a#
#525#10726#nd the Hab had exce#
#526#4592#lent medical suppli#
#527#53344#es. A quick shot of#
#528#63354# local anesthetic, #
#529#88227#irrigate the wound,#
#530#99143#stitches and I was #
#531#60629#done. I‚Äôd be taki#
#532#71460#ng antibiotics for #
#533#11093#a couple of weeks, #
#534#67088#but other than that#
#535#8262# I‚Äôd be fine.
##536#51871#I knew it was hopel#
#537#92035#ess, but I tried fi#
#538#4561#ring up the communi#
#539#17393#cation array. No si#
#540#24744#gnal, of course. Th#
#541#43128#e primary satelite #
#542#60008#dish had broken off#
#543#21437#remember? And it to#
#544#79708#ok the reception an#
#545#35536#tennae with it. The#
#546#14476# Hab had secondary #
#547#20599#and tertiary commun#
#548#67313#ication systems, bu#
#549#65304#t they were both ju#
#550#68993#for talking to the #
#551#45352#MAV, which would us#
#552#68451#e its much more pow#
#553#95467#erful systems to re#
#554#77635#lay to Hermes. Thin#
#555#48733#g is, that only wor#
#556#73684#ks if the MAV is st#
#557#64420#I had no way to tal#
#558#4685#k to Hermes. In tim#
#559#89758#e, I could locate t#
#560#11874#he dish out on the #
#561#79596#surface, but it wou#
#562#37811#ld take weeks for m#
#563#28638#e to rig up any rep#
#564#64591#airs, and that woul#
#565#55877#d be too late. In a#
#566#83861#n abort, Hermes wou#
#567#70801#ld leave orbit with#
#568#71320#in 24 hours. The or#
#569#74381#bital dynamics made#
#570#11832# the trip safer and#
#571#84040# shorter the earlie#
#572#31328#r you left, so why #
#573#35561#wait for no reason #
#574#50670#just to make the tr#
#575#36759#ip take longer?
##576#66966#Checking out my sui#
#577#88895#t, I saw the antenn#
#578#65607#a had plowed throug#
#579#42606#h my bio-monitor co#
#580#27829#mputer. When on an #
#581#96487#EVA, al the crew‚Äô#
#582#16065#networked so we can#
#583#96707# see each others st#
#584#66260#atus. The rest of t#
#585#69046#he crew would have #
#586#10554#seen the pressure i#
#587#96313#n my suit drop to n#
#588#17898#early 0, folowed
##589#94248#immediately by my b#
#590#89899#io-signs going flat#
#591#31114#. Add to that I was#
#592#96418# sent tumbling down#
#593#94347# a hil with a spear#
#594#70247# through me in the #
#595#24928#middle of a sandsto#
#596#51790#yeah. They thought #
#597#42471#I was dead. How cou#
#598#5055#They may have even #
#599#87945#had a brief discuss#
#600#59322#ion about recoverin#
#601#98463#g my body, but regu#
#602#10077#lations were clear.#
#603#44463# In the event a cre#
#604#59356#Mars, he stayed on #
#605#12897#Mars. Leaving his b#
#606#2422#ody behind reduced #
#607#38824#weight for the MAV #
#608#96724#on the trip back. T#
#609#93570#hat meant more disp#
#610#2830#osable fuel and a
##611#97752#larger margin of er#
#612#39913#ror for the return #
#613#38827#thrust. No point in#
#614#28457# giving that up for#
#615#48987# sentimentality.
##616#83764#So that‚Äôs the sit#
#617#74008#uation. I‚Äôm stran#
#618#58579#ded on Mars. I have#
#619#54522# no way to communic#
#620#73534#ate with Hermes or #
#621#99894#Earth. Everyone thi#
#622#44134#nks I‚Äôm dead. I‚Ä#
#623#7500#Hab designed to las#
#624#4595#If the Oxygenator b#
#625#24182#reaks down, I‚Äôl s#
#626#19568#uffocate. If the Wa#
#627#78397#ter Reclaimer break#
#628#94862#s down, I‚Äôl die o#
#629#37153#f thirst. If the Ha#

#635#26458#and starve to death#
#636#25305#So yeah. I‚Äôm fuck#
#637#18476#LOG ENTRY: SOL 7
##638#81423#Ok, I‚Äôve had a go#
#639#43001#od night‚Äôs sleep,#
#640#43399# and things don‚Äôt#
#641#9795# seem as hopeless a#
#642#21823#s they did yesterda#
#643#55153#Today I took stock #
#644#21769#of supplies, and di#
#645#56357#d a quick EVA to ch#
#646#78447#eck up on the exter#
#647#42584#nal equipment. Here#
#648#17972#‚Äôs my situation:#
#649#36913#The surface mission#
#650#71130# was supposed to be#
#651#96775# 31 days. For redun#
#652#6075#dancy, the supply p#
#653#14930#robes had enough fo#
#654#57581#od to last the whol#
#655#6221#e crew 56 days.
##656#41468#That way if one or #
#657#96652#two probes had prob#
#658#20561#lems, we'd stil hav#
#659#96328#e enough food to co#
#660#60465#mplete the mission.#
#661#40801#We were six days in#
#662#69199# when al hel broke #
#663#83655#loose, so that leav#
#664#29334#es enough food to f#
#665#74130#eed six people for #
#666#291#50 days. I‚Äôm just#
#667#45956# one guy, so it‚Äôl#
#668#2510#me 300 days. And th#
#669#26569#at‚Äôs if I don‚Äôt#
#670#18818# ration it. So I‚Äô#
#671#93775#ve got a fair bit o#
#672#65160#The Hab stood up to#
#673#56281# the storm without #
#674#58586#any problems. Outsi#
#675#60756#de, things aren‚Äôt#
#676#38000# so rosy. I can‚Äôt#
#677#74315# find the satelite #
#678#33998#dish; it probably g#
#679#27074#ot blown kilometers#
#680#94890#The MAV is gone, of#
#681#12853# course. My crewmat#
#682#72111#es took it up to He#
#683#34252#rmes. Though the bo#
#684#36047#ttom half (the land#
#685#51064#ing stage) is stil #
#686#26316#there. No reason
##687#47856#to take that back u#
#688#51619#p when weight is th#
#689#9902#e enemy. It include#
#690#73100#s the landing gear,#
#691#45608# the fuel plant, an#
#692#21271#d anything else NAS#
#693#51003#A figured it wouldn#
#694#94246#‚Äôt need for the t#
#695#51306#rip back up to orbi#
#696#95634#The MDV is on its s#
#697#670#ide and there‚Äôs a#
#698#39320# breach in the hul.#
#699#58718# Looks like the sto#
#700#12096#rm ripped the cowli#
#701#62937#ng off the reserve #
#702#87326#chute (which we did#
#703#62593#have to use on land#
#704#31284#ing). Once the chut#
#705#65503#e was exposed it dr#
#706#92209#agged the MDV al ov#
#707#31836#er the place, smash#
#708#63739#ing it against ever#
#709#85101#y rock in the area.#
#710#60916#Not that the MDV wo#
#711#47123#uld be much use to #
#712#33270#me. Its thrusters c#
#713#57000#an‚Äôt even lift it#
#714#99068#s own weight. But i#
#715#64310#t might have been v#
#716#58205#aluable for parts. #
#717#82280#Might stil be.
##718#54393#Both rovers are hal#
#719#829#f-buried in sand, b#
#720#50072#ut they‚Äôre in goo#
#721#90061#d shape otherwise. #
#722#26499#Their pressure seal#
#723#72113#s are in-tact. Make#
#724#21088#s sense. Operating#
#725#48225#procedure if a stor#

#727#54908#otion and wait for #
#728#75845#the storm to pass. #
#729#48539#They‚Äôre made to s#

##741#76980#working order for a#
#742#89653#l I know. The Hab‚Ä#
#743#35301#ôs communications a#
#744#76501#re so weak right no#
#745#56764#w it probably can‚Ä#
#746#29394#ôt even reach a kil#
#747#55369#The solar cel array#
#748#92959# was covered it in #
#749#45742#sand, rendering it #
#750#49743#useless (hint: sola#
#751#311#r cels need sunligh#
#752#10603#t to make electrici#
#753#69518#ty). But once I swe#
#754#47115#them off, they retu#
#755#63114#rned to ful efficie#
#756#60847#ncy. Whatever I end#
#757#39494# up doing, I‚Äôl ha#
#758#4687#ve plenty of power #

#761#34372#s, with hydrogen fu#
#762#64660#el cels to store pl#

#764#41884# I need to do is sw#

#767#38008#great, thanks to th#
#768#66242#e Hab‚Äôs sturdy de#
#769#38732#I ran a ful diagnos#

#772#58293#erfect. If anything#
#773#50823# goes wrong with it#
#774#7788#, there is a short-#
#775#76872#term spare I can us#
#776#88640#e. But it‚Äôs solel#
#777#3512#y for emergency use#
#778#17338# while repairing th#
#779#43624#e main one. The spa#
#780#95115#re doesn‚Äôt actual#

#782#84132# recapture the oxyg#
#783#9347#absorbs the CO2 the#

#788#6575#tes the filters, wh#

#790#35590#or me (just one per#

#794#76151#The Water Reclaimer#
#795#1285# is working fine, t#
#796#75758#oo. The bad news is#
#797#59076# there‚Äôs no backu#
#798#6401#p. If it stops work#
#799#26616#ing, I‚Äôl be drink#

#820#629#Meals are pretty mi#

#990#4108#Why bring a botanis#

#992#70967#, it‚Äôs famous for#
#993#62260# not having anythin#
#994#23304#g growing here. Wel#
#995#81319#, the idea was to f#
#996#46056#igure out how wel
##997#71034#things grow in Mart#
#998#70348#ian gravity, and se#
#999#33034#e what, if anything#
#1000#16686#, we can do with Ma#
#1001#7232#rtian soil. The sho#
#1002#73718#rt answer is: quite#
#1003#63668# a lot‚Ä¶ almost. M#
#1004#70845#artian soil has the#
#1005#64123# basic building blo#
#1006#20321#cks needed for plan#

#1008#4666#‚Äôs a lot of stuff#
#1009#20981# going on in Earth #
#1010#82210#soil that Mars soil#
#1011#64951# doesn‚Äôt have, ev#
#1012#81470#en when it‚Äôs plac#
#1013#91981#ed in an Earth-atmo#

#1019#27581#, etc. None of that#
#1020#86096# is happening on Ma#

#1022#89704# for the mission wa#
#1023#14059#s to see how plants#
#1024#61381# grow here, in vari#
#1025#38693#ous combinations of#

#1027#4561# and atmosphere.
##1028#55982#That‚Äôs why I have#
#1029#36038# a smal amount of E#

#1031#37456#ch of plant seeds w#

#2075#59061#dd oxygen. Burn.
##2076#32822#Let‚Äôs take them o#
#2077#71796#ne at a time. I‚Äôl#
#2078#39475# start with oxygen.#
#2079#54037#I have a fair bit o#
#2080#3203#f O2 reserves, but #
#2081#54758#not enough to make #
#2082#94595#250 liters of water#
#2083#48525#. Two high-pressure#
#2084#76329# tanks at one end o#
#2085#28232#f the Hab are my
##2086#86340#entire supply (plus#
#2087#22723# the air in the Hab#
#2088#24315# of course). They e#
#2089#91586#ach contain 25 lite#
#2090#74995#rs of liquid O2. Th#
#2091#69951#e Hab would only us#
#2092#31169#e them in an emerge#
#2093#78669#ncy; it has the Oxy#
#2094#67251#genator to balance #
#2095#84656#the atmosphere. The#
#2096#98294# reason the O2 tank#
#2097#2319#s are here is to fe#
#2098#14907#ed the spacesuits a#
#2099#24757#Anyway, the reserve#
#2100#72259# oxygen would only #
#2101#60299#be enough to make 1#
#2102#61719#00L of water (50L o#
#2103#74671#f O2 makes 100L of #
#2104#42892#molecules that only#
#2105#66047#O each). That would#
#2106#49609# mean no EVAs for m#
#2107#42056#e, and no emergency#
#2108#10450# reserves. And it w#
#2109#51423#ould make less than#
#2110#69784# half the water I n#
#2111#64507#eed. Out of the
##2112#8198#But oxygen‚Äôs easi#
#2113#77321#er to find on Mars #
#2114#66727#than you might thin#
#2115#47045#k. The atmosphere i#
#2116#87772#s 98% CO2. And I ha#
#2117#30291#ppen to have a mach#
#2118#6719#ine whose sole
##2119#84582#purpose is liberati#
#2120#20276#ng oxygen from CO2.#
#2121#83851# Yay Oxygenator!
##2122#19331#One problem: The at#
#2123#50664#mosphere is very th#
#2124#62985#in. About 1/90th th#
#2125#23835#e pressure on Earth#
#2126#70871#. So it‚Äôs hard to#
#2127#17201# colect. Getting ai#
#2128#87874#r from outside to
##2129#34878#inside is nearly im#
#2130#29304#possible. The whole#
#2131#26292# purpose of the Hab#
#2132#5619# is to keep that so#
#2133#99272#rt of thing from ha#
#2134#10602#ppening. The tiny a#
#2135#94654#mount of Martian
##2136#67187#atmosphere that ent#
#2137#764#ers when I use an a#
#2138#20764#irlock is laughable#
#2139#16301#That‚Äôs where the #
#2140#86220#MAV fuel plant come#
#2141#32872#My crewmates took t#
#2142#61183#he MAV away weeks a#
#2143#68864#go. But the bottom #
#2144#60947#half of it stayed b#
#2145#36363#ehind. NASA is not #
#2146#2017#in the habit of put#
#2147#40032#unnecessary shit in#
#2148#51943# to orbit. It left #
#2149#52679#the landing gear, i#
#2150#55863#ngress ramp, and fu#
#2151#9775#el plant behind. Re#
#2152#42190#member how the MAV #
#2153#25922#made its own fuel w#
#2154#94673#ith help from the M#
#2155#63057#artian atmosphere? #
#2156#15063#Step one of that is#
#2157#70689# to colect CO2 and #
#2158#62354#store it in a high #
#2159#25304#pressure vessel. On#
#2160#76000#ce I get that hooke#
#2161#46256#d up to the Hab‚Äôs#
#2162#57027# power, it‚Äôl give#
#2163#18358# me half a liter of#
#2164#41946# liquid CO2 per hou#
#2165#4219#r, indefinitely. Af#
#2166#34723#ter 5 days it‚Äôl h#
#2167#37212#ave made 125L of CO#
#2168#73590#2, which wil make 1#
#2169#56221#25L of O2 after I f#
#2170#21709#eed it through the #
#2171#81861#That‚Äôs enough to #
#2172#47911#make 250L of water.#
#2173#13020# So I have a plan f#
#2174#41159#The hydrogen wil be#
#2175#66270# a little trickier.#
#2176#32696#I considered raidin#
#2177#11529#g the hydrogen fuel#
#2178#31519#-cels, but I need t#
#2179#31397#hose batteries to m#
#2180#17277#aintain power at ni#
#2181#87627#ght. If I don‚Äôt h#
#2182#82314#ave that, It‚Äôl ge#
#2183#61619#I could bundle up, #
#2184#4326#but the cold would #
#2185#40520#kil my crops. And e#
#2186#69822#ach fuel cel only h#
#2187#79160#as a smal amount of#
#2188#23987# H2 anyway. It‚Äôs #
#2189#44350#just not worth sacr#
#2190#63209#ificing so much use#
#2191#98658#fulness for so litt#
#2192#55850#le gain. The one th#
#2193#18332#ing I have going fo#
#2194#56427#r me is that energy#
#2195#77187# is not a problem. #
#2196#1697#I don‚Äôt want to g#
#2197#58409#So I‚Äôl have to go#
#2198#22358# a different route.#
#2199#56268#I often talk about #
#2200#54220#the MAV. But now I #
#2201#85423#want to talk about #
#2202#35522#During the most ter#
#2203#58127#rifying 23 minutes #
#2204#73116#of my life, four of#
#2205#41009# my crewmates and I#
#2206#45801# tried not to shit #
#2207#64934#ourselves while Mar#
#2208#66207#tinez piloted the M#
#2209#21726#down to the surface#
#2210#65699#. It was kind of li#
#2211#12690#ke being in a tumbl#
#2212#96432#First, we descended#
#2213#67760# from Hermes, and d#
#2214#7480#ecelerated our orbi#
#2215#78178#tal velocity so we #
#2216#37169#could start faling #
#2217#18447#properly. Everythin#
#2218#28185#g was smooth until#
#2219#64906#we hit the atmosphe#
#2220#11756#re. If you think tu#
#2221#70331#rbulence is rough i#
#2222#45582#n a jetliner going #
#2223#91914#720kph, just imagin#
#2224#51236#e what it‚Äôs like #
#2225#50775#Several staged sets#
#2226#28905# of chutes deployed#
#2227#684# automaticaly to sl#
#2228#67270#ow our descent, the#
#2229#60479#n Martinez manualy #
#2230#8825#piloted us to the g#
#2231#85507#round, using the
##2232#18611#thrusters to slow d#
#2233#51390#escent and control #
#2234#96882#our lateral motion.#
#2235#80802# He‚Äôd trained for#

#2239#12287#exceeded al plausib#

#2241#19980#landings, putting u#
#2242#59233#s just nine meters #
#2243#58697#from the target. Th#
#2244#21813#e guy just plain ow#
#2245#50309#ned that landing.
##2246#90538#Thanks, Martinez! Y#
#2247#9337#ou may have saved m#
#2248#56124#Not because of the #
#2249#88650#perfect landing, bu#
#2250#93376#t because he left s#
#2251#94348#o much fuel behind.#
#2252#53290# Hundreds of liters#
#2253#32437# of unused Hydrazin#
#2254#84063#e. Each molecule of#
#2255#91791#Hydrazine has four #
#2256#40492#hydrogen atoms in i#
#2257#21878#t. So each liter of#
#2258#65140# Hydrazine has enou#
#2259#75284#gh hydrogen for *tw#
#2260#48808#o* liters of water.#
#2261#50296#I did a little EVA #
#2262#77762#today to check. The#
#2263#64848# MDV has 292L of ju#
#2264#53065#ice left in the tan#
#2265#19596#ks. Enough to make #

#2274#47637#I do it in an oxyge#

#2279#22750#e a lot of H2O at t#
#2280#3195#he end, but I‚Äôl b#
#2281#93601#dead to appreciate #
#2282#72644#At its root, Hydraz#
#2283#500#ine is pretty simpl#
#2284#99151#e. The Germans used#
#2285#3799# it as far back as #
#2286#69435#World War II for ro#

#2288#66988#occasionaly blew th#

#2290#79165#Al you have to do i#
#2291#43775#s run it over a cat#
#2292#88415#alyst (which I can #
#2293#62779#extract from the MD#
#2294#45616#V engine) and it wi#
#2295#13318#l turn in to nitrog#
#2296#44228#en and hydrogen. I‚#
#2297#40366#spare you the chemi#
#2298#95252#stry, but the end r#
#2299#29414#esult is that 5 mol#
#2300#88114#ecules of Hydrazine#
#2301#14506# becomes 5 molecule#
#2302#65845#s of harmless N2 an#
#2303#93647#d 10 molecules of
##2304#6061#lovely H2. During t#
#2305#80163#his process, it goe#
#2306#48205#s through an interm#
#2307#75494#ediate step of bein#

#2309#35482#y, being the sloppy#
#2310#56506# bitch it is, ensur#
#2311#46990#there‚Äôl be some a#
#2312#88423#mmonia that doesn‚Ä#
#2313#33959#ôt react with the H#

#2315#27135# just stay ammonia.#
#2316#12940# You like the smel #

#2320#61785#The chemistry is on#

#2324#8157#reaction happen slo#
#2325#66459#wly and how do I co#
#2326#96300#hydrogen? The answe#
#2327#65399#r is: I don‚Äôt kno#
#2328#805#I suppose I‚Äôl thi#
#2329#1103#nk of something. Or#
#2330#79084#Anyway, much more i#
#2331#10774#mportant: I simply #
#2332#2584#can‚Äôt abide the r#
#2333#87161#eplacement of Chris#
#2334#50307#sie with Cindy. ‚Äú#
#2335#386#Three‚Äôs Company‚Ä#
#2336#55969#ù may never be the#
#2337#38435#same after this fia#
#2338#15605#sco. Time wil tel.#
#2339#5378#LOG ENTRY: SOL 32
##2340#65250#So I ran in to a bu#
#2341#88426#nch of problems wit#
#2342#85286#h my water plan.
##2343#78978#My idea is to make #
#2344#85888#600L of water (limi#
#2345#64176#ted by the hydrogen#
#2346#41023# I can get from the#
#2347#89701# Hydrazine). That m#
#2348#8667#eans I‚Äôl need 300#
#2349#83886#L of liquid O2.
##2350#41050#I can create the O2#
#2351#87418# easily enough. It #
#2352#62697#takes 20 hours for #
#2353#34117#the MAV fuel plant #
#2354#76307#to fil its 10L tank#
#2355#2064# with CO2. The Oxyg#
#2356#11332#enator can turn it #
#2357#35811#to O2, then the Atm#
#2358#60668#ospheric Regulator #
#2359#15413#wil see the O2 cont#
#2360#27574#ent in the Hab is h#
#2361#44233#igh, and pul it out#
#2362#70891# of the air, storin#
#2363#12206#g it in the main O2#
#2364#59852#They‚Äôd fil up, so#
#2365#71236# I‚Äôd have to tran#
#2366#13069#sfer O2 over to the#
#2367#30627# rovers‚Äô tanks an#
#2368#17212#d even space suit t#
#2369#54068#anks as necessary.#
#2370#4239#But I can‚Äôt creat#
#2371#67780#e it very quickly. #
#2372#62975#At 1/2L of CO2 per #
#2373#28541#hour, it wil take 2#
#2374#34733#5 days to make the #
#2375#2904#oxygen I need. That#
#2376#56248#‚Äôs longer than I‚#
#2377#30906#Also, there‚Äôs the#
#2378#30127# problem of storing#
#2379#39402# the hydrogen. The #
#2380#88260#air tanks of the Ha#
#2381#7235#b, the rovers, and #
#2382#1997#al the space suits #
#2383#93447#add up to exactly 3#
#2384#2606#of storage. To hold#
#2385#61785# al the materials f#
#2386#20000#or water, I would n#
#2387#38768#eed a whopping 900L#
#2388#49510#I considered using #
#2389#39323#one of the rovers a#
#2390#43967#s a ‚Äútank‚Äù. It #
#2391#46551#would certainly be #
#2392#22069#big enough, but it #
#2393#60059#just isn‚Äôt design#
#2394#69625#ed to hold in that #
#2395#58529#pressure. It‚Äôs ma#
#2396#42803#de to hold (you gue#
#2397#75567#ssed it) one atmosp#
#2398#19978#here. I need vessel#
#2399#96715#s that can hold 50 #
#2400#16530#times that much. I‚#
#2401#62133#Äôm sure a rover wo#
#2402#4418#The best way to sto#
#2403#52210#re the ingredients #
#2404#914#of water is to make#
#2405#54524# them be water. So #
#2406#50113#what‚Äôs what I‚Äôl#
#2407#77801#The concept is simp#
#2408#27589#le, but the executi#
#2409#40732#on wil be incredibl#
#2410#53673#Every 20 hours, I‚Ä#
#2411#55100#ôl have 10L of CO2 #
#2412#97729#thanks to the MAV f#
#2413#57629#uel plant. I‚Äôl ve#
#2414#16035#nt it in to the Hab#
#2415#89347# via the highly sci#
#2416#29197#entific method of
##2417#1800#detaching the tank #
#2418#85085#from the MAV landin#
#2419#3896#g struts, bringing #
#2420#61895#it in to the Hab, t#
#2421#63584#hen opening the val#
#2422#92199#ve until it‚Äôs emp#
#2423#16896#The Oxygenator wil #
#2424#79245#turn it in to oxyge#
#2425#33355#n in its own time.#
#2426#89593#Then, I‚Äôl release#
#2427#29395# Hydrazine, VERY SL#
#2428#35475#OWLY, over the irid#
#2429#37733#ium catalyst, to tu#
#2430#74073#rn it in to N2 and #
#2431#428#H2. I‚Äôl direct th#
#2432#11264#e hydrogen to a sma#
#2433#53237#area and burn it.
##2434#88942#As you can see, thi#
#2435#98700#s plan provides man#
#2436#64609#y opportunities for#
#2437#95550# me to die in a fie#
#2438#20022#Firstly, Hydrazine #
#2439#92949#is some serious dea#
#2440#86426#th. If I make any m#
#2441#48538#istakes, there‚Äôl #
#2442#31112#be nothing left but#
#2443#96045# the ‚ÄúMark Watney#

#2449#1175# stil the matter of#
#2450#50783# burning hydrogen. #
#2451#42293#I‚Äôm going to be s#
#2452#78512#etting a fire. In t#
#2453#88554#he Hab. On purpose.#
#2454#66642#If you asked every #

##2564#6671#The tanks have manu#

##2952#53713#Over the past few d#

#2958#18401#I even beefed up th#

##2965#41275#even faster now.
##2966#98736#After my initial bu#

#3035#59249#, the Hab evenly di#
#3036#5968#stributes the gain #

#3040#99052#That‚Äôs not a prob#

#3043#17942# does mean I‚Äôve b#

#3046#43321#I‚Äôm not consuming#

#3275#29633#But that leads to y#
#3276#22874#et another problem.#
#3277#8787# The potato plants #

#3279#74142#They don‚Äôt mind t#
#3280#71872#he lack of oxygen b#
#3281#26726#ut the cold wil kil#
#3282#8765# them. So I‚Äôl hav#
#3283#86217#e to pot them (bag #
#3284#63737#them, actualy) and #
#3285#75693#move them to a rove#
#3286#96812#They haven‚Äôt even#
#3287#5413# sprouted yet, so i#
#3288#23147#t‚Äôs not like they#
#3289#28632#It was surprisingly#

#3297#62051#t time in here.
##3298#17232#So that‚Äôs the pla#
#3299#49477#n. First, bag the p#
#3300#27834#otato plants and br#
#3301#97062#ing them to the rov#
#3302#18701#er (make sure it ke#
#3303#55468#eps the damn heater#
#3304#20353# on). Then drop the#
#3305#36271#temperature to 1C. #
#3306#58717#Then reduce to O2 c#
#3307#41875#ontent to 1%. Then #
#3308#14861#burn off the hydrog#
#3309#93610#en with a battery, #
#3310#85233#some wires, and a t#
#3311#78173#Yeah. This al sound#
#3312#78387#s like a great idea#
#3313#2867# with no chance of #
#3314#4844#catastrophic failur#
#3315#9293#That was sarcasm, b#
#3316#10219#Wel, off I go.

#3325#44534#I summoned up the c#
#3326#75#ourage to return to#

##3340#13275#I bagged the potato#

#3342#96196#chance to check up #
#3343#24516#on them while I was#
#3344#99275# at it. They‚Äôre r#
#3345#75959#ooting nicely and a#

#3347#381#thing I hadn‚Äôt ac#

#3355#8594# I dragged it out w#

#3364#6276#y chily. Down to 5C#

#3366#950# and seeing my brea#
#3367#42688#th condense in fron#
#3368#41379#t of me, I threw on#
#3369#62180#extra layers of clo#

#3371#43349#‚Äôm not a very big#

#3386#24095#Once the temperatur#

#3396#41856#y swaggering confid#

#3402#54912#The lowest I could #

#3404#62671#After that, it flat#
#3405#1208#ly refused to go lo#

#3423#56082#So I had to use mor#

#3425#11049#The regulator uses #
#3426#74262#a different set of #

#3432#97308# comes in through a#

#3439#98079#That way it gets a #

#3450#47840# the neck-hole of a#

#3549#88801#I flicked the switc#

#3561#51231#bursts. Nothing fla#

#3563#91134# take my time.
##3564#44289#I was elated! This #
#3565#22082#was the best plan e#

#3567#33805# clearing out the h#

#3575#41101# on the other side #
#3576#84329#of the Hab and a lo#

#3578#76519#stumbled to my feet#

#3589#36264#for a head-wound I #
#3590#41540#desperately hoped w#

#3592#86049#Nothing seemed to b#
#3593#16115#But feeling al over#
#3594#20995# my head and face r#
#3595#83376#evealed the true pr#
#3596#23460#oblem. My oxygen ma#
#3597#7232#sk had been ripped #
#3598#33659#off in the blast. I#
#3599#44134# was breathing
##3600#40464#nearly pure nitroge#
#3601#51009#The floor was cover#

#3612#18742#. It hadn‚Äôt moved#
#3613#23313# in the blast. It w#
#3614#26168#as heavy to start w#
#3615#27248#ith and had 70L of #
#3616#66382#Rushing over, I qui#
#3617#34525#ckly cranked on the#
#3618#76611# O2 and stuck my he#
#3619#40511#ad into the neck-ho#
#3620#52035#le (I‚Äôd removed t#
#3621#49954#he helmet long ago,#
#3622#32233# for easy access to#

##3628#295#Stil holding my bre#

#3630#61368# to the spacesuit a#
#3631#9448#nd Hefty bag I‚Äôd #
#3632#59526#used to outsmart th#
#3633#72558#e regulator. The ba#

#3635#70474#removed them. The g#
#3636#78718#ood news is the exp#
#3637#26501#losion removed them#
#3638#28221#. Eight of the nine#
#3639#87245# intakes for the re#
#3640#87018#gulator were stil b#
#3641#8064#agged, but this one#
#3642#12155#would at least tel #
#3643#89755#Stumbling over to t#

#3645#55266#ned it back on.
##3646#75990#After a two second #

##3659#8273#could. Separating o#

##3726#77208#I spent the day run#
#3727#12252#ning ful diagnostic#
#3728#52397#s on every system i#

##3737#95500#I did the most crit#

#3755#78841#Then I checked the #

##3778#41417#Then came the criti#

#3780#51390#g the dirt. Taking #
#3781#61206#a few samples from #

#3783#71534#member, it‚Äôs al d#
#3784#12924#irt flooring now), #
#3785#36036#made some slides.
##3786#38003#I took them over to#
#3787#71483# the microscope and#
#3788#7924# checked up on my b#
#3789#45349#eloved bacteria. I #
#3790#76152#breathed a sigh of #
#3791#30544#relief when I saw h#
#3792#28878#ealthy, active
##3793#5000#bacteria doing thei#
#3794#7643#Then I set about cl#
#3795#33771#eaning up the mess.#
#3796#5968# And I had a lot of#
#3797#86849# time to think abou#
#3798#21150#t what had happened#
#3799#75950#So what happened? W#
#3800#6435#el, I have a theory#
#3801#3329#According to the ma#
#3802#55820#in computer, during#
#3803#87254# the blast, the int#
#3804#4656#ernal pressure spik#
#3805#84628#ed to 1.4 atmospher#
#3806#78679#es, and the tempera#
#3807#30557#ture rose to 15C in#
#3808#56439#under a second. But#
#3809#77853# the pressure quick#
#3810#51225#ly subsided back to#
#3811#55819# 1atm. This would m#
#3812#39305#ake sense if the At#
#3813#38663#mospheric Regulator#
#3814#33756# were on, but I‚Äôd#
#3815#27233#The temperature rem#
#3816#59305#ained 15C for some #
#3817#983#time afterward, so #
#3818#21727#any heat expansion #
#3819#11574#should stil have be#
#3820#37192#en present. But the#
#3821#23544#dropped down again,#
#3822#44078# so where did that #
#3823#23429#extra pressure go? #
#3824#6010#Raising the tempera#
#3825#64599#ture and keeping th#
#3826#45611#e same number of at#
#3827#30780#oms inside should
##3828#95792#permanently raise t#
#3829#61724#he pressure. But it#
#3830#16762#I quickly realized #
#3831#86092#the answer. The hyd#
#3832#35872#rogen (the only ava#
#3833#23896#ilable thing to bur#
#3834#91664#n) combined with ox#
#3835#16687#ygen (hence combust#
#3836#64377#ion) and became
##3837#44728#water. Water is a t#
#3838#27037#housand times as de#
#3839#8973#nse as a gas. So th#
#3840#2144#e heat added to the#
#3841#6635# pressure, and the #
#3842#26696#transformation of h#
#3843#32673#ydrogen and oxygen #
#3844#39563#to water brought it#
#3845#68388# back down again.
##3846#99707#The milion dolar qu#
#3847#65096#estion is: Where th#
#3848#74260#e hel did the oxyge#
#3849#25883#n come from? The wh#
#3850#57168#ole plan was to lim#
#3851#94781#it oxygen and keep #
#3852#99154#from happening. And#
#3853#46353# it was working for#
#3854#40371# quite a while befo#
#3855#75590#re blowing up.
##3856#61604#I think I have my a#
#3857#6623#nswer. And it comes#
#3858#52345# down to me brain-f#
#3859#27140#arting. Remember wh#
#3860#50046#en I decided not to#
#3861#64586# wear a spacesuit? #
#3862#66361#almost kiled me.
##3863#18037#The medical O2 tank#
#3864#51379# mixes pure oxygen #
#3865#22899#with surrounding ai#
#3866#2843#r, then feeds it to#
#3867#46445# you through a mask#
#3868#89894#. The mask stays on#
#3869#60892# your face with a
##3870#80829#little rubber band #
#3871#5484#that goes around th#
#3872#51412#e back of your neck#
#3873#63437#. Not an air-tight #
#3874#67756#I know what you‚Äôr#
#3875#12018#e thinking. The mas#
#3876#2458#k leaked oxygen. Bu#
#3877#260#t no. I was breathi#
#3878#22638#ng the oxygen. When#
#3879#25793# I was inhaling, I #
#3880#62218#airtight seal with #
#3881#98917#the mask by sucking#
#3882#99077# it to my face.
##3883#99763#The problem was the#
#3884#70865# exhale. Do you kno#
#3885#51940#w how much oxygen y#
#3886#29843#ou absorb out of th#
#3887#26832#e air when you take#
#3888#85884# a normal breath? I#
#3889#17717#either, but it‚Äôs #
#3890#97199#not 100%. With ever#
#3891#71443#y breath, I was tak#
#3892#22691#ing in oxygen, my l#
#3893#84828#ungs grabbed some o#
#3894#6353#f it, then I was br#
#3895#52051#eathing it out into#
#3896#92018#Every time I exhale#
#3897#49985#d, I added more oxy#
#3898#29035#gen to the system.#
#3899#96418#It just didn‚Äôt oc#
#3900#26757#cur to me. But it s#
#3901#651#hould have. If your#
#3902#22135# lungs grabbed up a#
#3903#54207#l the oxygen, mouth#
#3904#34104#-to-mouth resuscita#
#3905#61660#tion wouldn‚Äôt wor#

##5292#70789#Our mission had a 1#

##5309#20290#There‚Äôs just one #

#5311#49993#Part of the battery#
#5312#91399# power goes to heat#

##5318#58374#But I‚Äôl be living#

#5323#86602# up 400W. Keeping i#

##5328#63002#But I do have a fre#

#5341#55270#, I can deactivate #

#5348#42452#According to my bor#

#5351#23453#of juice to go 1km,#
#5352#17163# so using the ful 1#

#5361#10426#it‚Äôs a good balpa#

#5487#27298#wide strips, then u#
#5488#96010#sed them to make a #
#5489#9268#sort of harness.
##5490#88412#I used the resin an#

##5507#19679#I dragged the batte#

#6156#44648#I set out at first #

#6170#59223#That‚Äôs very good!#
#6171#49146# Mind you, the land#

#6261#76141#CO2 isn‚Äôt a probl#

#6272#35727#ôve used 131 hours #
#6273#73750#of filter on variou#

#6276#30191#The rover was desig#

##6284#29893#Mars has 1/90th Ear#
#6285#4977#th‚Äôs atmospheric #
#6286#2932#pressure. The insid#
#6287#69769#e of the rover has #
#6288#51334#1 atmosphere. So th#
#6289#26640#e oxygen tanks are #
#6290#93198#on the inside (less#
#6291#55047#pressure differenti#
#6292#13203#al to deal with). W#
#6293#19990#hy does that matter#
#6294#82976#? It means I can br#

#6311#58235# in a comfortable a#

##6313#79230#story short: with t#
#6314#4755#he Hab tank, I have#
#6315#83090# enough O2 to last #
#6316#87037#42 days. That‚Äôl b#
#6317#89926#Sirius 4 wil be a 2#
#6318#1206#That may seem a bit#

##6343#62490#A bigger problem is#

#6352#23979#The problem is: Whe#

##7514#71273#It‚Äôs the evening #

#7517#41497#‚Äù has been a succ#

#7521#6331#dawn. First thing I#
#7522#34643# do is check oxygen#
#7523#58334# and CO2 levels. Th#
#7524#4709#en I eat a breakfas#
#7525#66696#pack and drink a cu#
#7526#59742#p of water. After t#
#7527#64305#hat, I brush my tee#
#7528#21028#th, using as little#
#7529#16312# water as possible,#
#7530#88269# and shave with an #
#7531#42219#electric razor.
##7532#68204#The rover has no to#
#7533#1340#ilet. We were expec#
#7534#95159#ted to use our suit#
#7535#97771#s‚Äô reclamation sy#
#7536#76034#stems for that. But#
#7537#99659# they aren‚Äôt desi#
#7538#30991#gned to hold twenty#

##7540#10246#My morning piss goe#
#7541#84099#s in a resealable p#

#7544#80123#reeks like a truck-#
#7545#10959#stop men‚Äôs room. #
#7546#69893#I could take it out#
#7547#64200#and let it boil off#
#7548#53248#. But I worked hard#
#7549#79158# to make that water#
#7550#40533#, and the last thin#
#7551#12979#g I‚Äôm going to do#
#7552#13736# is waste it. I‚Äôl#
#7553#59948# feed it to the Wat#

#7555#96780#Even more precious #

##7570#50684#Then I go outside a#

##7599#52558#I can go almost 2 h#

#7633#61225# nothing to do. And#
#7634#57871# I‚Äôm getting sick#
#7635#19949# of this rover. The#

#7724#99490#Our landing site is#
#7725#83624# at the delta of a #

#7728#86127#oscopic fossils to #
#7729#37369#be had, it‚Äôs a go#

#7731#51047#lso, the water woul#
#7732#2589#d have dragged rock#

#7738#57965#That‚Äôs great for #

#7740#49188#ns the Hab‚Äôs in a#
#7741#54536# featureless wastel#
#7742#58982#I considered making#
#7743#14854# a compass. The rov#
#7744#90639#er has plenty of el#
#7745#17714#ectricity and the m#
#7746#37778#ed kit has a needle#
#7747#38400#. Only one problem:#
#7748#53605# Mars doesn‚Äôt hav#
#7749#16053#a magnetic field.
##7750#90059#So I navigate by Ph#
#7751#34822#obos. It whips arou#
#7752#25107#nd Mars so fast it #
#7753#87499#actualy rises and s#
#7754#11369#ets twice a day, ru#

#7756#51026# It‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the#
#7757#68277#accurate system, bu#
#7758#72329#Things got easier o#
#7759#71470#n Sol 75. I reached#
#7760#51708# a valey with a ris#
#7761#15768#e to the west. It h#
#7762#74297#ad flat ground for #
#7763#46205#easy driving, and I#
#7764#89555# just needed to fol#
#7765#66814#ow the edge of the #
#7766#87617#hils. I named it ‚Ä#
#7767#47507#úLewis Valey‚Äù aft#
#7768#53860#er our fearless lea#
#7769#28500#der. She‚Äôd love i#
#7770#36985#t there, geology ne#
#7771#42139#rd that she is.
##7772#13148#Three sols later, L#
#7773#14372#ewis Valey opened i#
#7774#9901#nto a wide plain. S#
#7775#81149#o, again, I was lef#
#7776#91378#t without reference#
#7777#67447#s and relied on Pho#
#7778#83791#bos to guide me.
##7779#26281#There‚Äôs probably #
#7780#92262#symbolism there. Ph#
#7781#85665#obos is the god of #
#7782#43787#fear, and I‚Äôm let#
#7783#25308#ting it be my guide#
#7784#884#. Not a good sign.#
#7785#79228#But today, my luck #
#7786#39188#finaly changed. Aft#
#7787#42233#er two sols wanderi#
#7788#64489#ng the desert, I fo#
#7789#54165#und something to na#

##7792#48585#smal it didn‚Äôt ev#
#7793#48556#en have a listed na#

#7795#22074#as the Lighthouse o#

#7798#57265#I knew exactly wher#

#7832#95974#strewn with ejecta #

#8039#76347#it didn‚Äôt budge.#
#8040#55142#Just like the other#

#8049#64130# have to dig to get#
#8050#76810# to them. It wouldn#
#8051#92021#‚Äôt be hard, it‚Äô#
#8052#76308#s just sand. But th#
#8053#74355#e other three panel#
#8054#95239#s were in the damn #
#8055#47040#I quickly realized #
#8056#32361#I didn‚Äôt give a c#
#8057#50410#rap about the condi#
#8058#61266#tion of the other p#
#8059#1448#anels. I went back #
#8060#62351#to my rover, cut so#
#8061#18504#me strips of Hab ma#
#8062#3539#terial, then braide#
#8063#37944#d them in to a prim#
#8064#72240#itive but strong ro#
#8065#49953#pe. I can‚Äôt take #
#8066#52698#credit for it being#
#8067#58839# strong. Thank NASA#
#8068#61091# for that. I just m#
#8069#44992#ade it rope-shaped.#
#8070#32953#I tied one end to a#
#8071#55767# panel, and the oth#
#8072#18707#er to the rover. Th#
#8073#61270#e rover was made fo#
#8074#56441#r traversing extrem#
#8075#66070#ely rugged terrain,#
#8076#16112# often at steep ang#
#8077#25654#It may not be fast,#
#8078#91632# but it has great t#
#8079#4874#orque. I towed the #
#8080#82024#panel away like a r#
#8081#29274#edneck removing a t#
#8082#13153#Now I had a place t#
#8083#96434#o dig. As I exposed#
#8084#54012# each baloon, I cut#
#8085#79631# it off. The whole #
#8086#66162#task took an hour.#
#8087#84984#Then I hoisted the #
#8088#57928#central panel assem#
#8089#64843#bly up and carried #
#8090#25324#it confidently to t#
#8091#49514#At least, that‚Äôs #
#8092#48191#what I wanted to do#
#8093#10143#. The damn thing is#
#8094#38767# stil heavy as hel.#
#8095#20047# I‚Äôm guessing it‚#
#8096#86196#Äôs 200kg. Even in #
#8097#71866#Mar's gravity that'#
#8098#70138#much. I could carry#
#8099#22650# it around the Hab #
#8100#42430#easily enough, but #
#8101#43821#lifting it while we#
#8102#54031#aring an awkward EV#
#8103#9814#A suit? Out of the #
#8104#91412#So I dragged it to #
#8105#59033#Now for my next fea#
#8106#38274#t: Getting it on th#
#8107#90877#The roof was empty #
#8108#68#at the moment. Even#
#8109#42640# with mostly-ful ba#
#8110#32390#tteries, I had set #
#8111#75978#up the solar cels w#
#8112#44712#hen I stopped. Why #
#8113#50640#not? Free energy.
##8114#48849#I‚Äôd worked it out#
#8115#55354# in advance. On the#
#8116#91923# way here, two stac#
#8117#48929#ks of solar panels #
#8118#27980#occupied the whole #
#8119#90618#roof. On the way ba#
#8120#66105#ck, they would be a#
#8121#68833#single stack. It‚Äô#
#8122#74551#s a little more dan#
#8123#7197#gerous; they might #
#8124#93434#fal over. The main #
#8125#29806#thing it they‚Äôl b#
#8126#45229#e a pain in the ass#
#8127#60763# to stack that high#
#8128#2686#I can‚Äôt just thro#
#8129#4792#w a rope over the r#
#8130#1045#over and hoist Path#
#8131#75519#finder up the side.#
#8132#75673# I don‚Äôt want to #
#8133#71626#break it. I mean, i#
#8134#99544#t‚Äôs already broke#
#8135#55750#n, they lost contac#
#8136#44601#t in 1997. But I do#
#8137#2732#n‚Äôt want to break#
#8138#16997#I came up with a so#
#8139#26476#lution, but I‚Äôd d#
#8140#92471#one enough physical#
#8141#52608# labor for one day,#
#8142#11123# and I was almost o#
#8143#27641#ut of daylight.
##8144#57478#Now I‚Äôm in the ro#
#8145#81697#ver, looking at Soj#
#8146#41636#ourner. It seems al#
#8147#84195# right. No physical#

#8150#50771# like anything got #

#8156#62691#You may think Sojou#

#8159#87624#t communicate with #
#8160#80582#Earth. Why do I car#
#8161#57877#Because it has a lo#
#8162#42889#t of moving parts.#
#8163#55881#If I establish a li#

#8170#14027#me? The only moving#
#8171#22523# parts on the Lande#

#8173#50532# antenna (which wou#

##8177#61276#We‚Äôd have to come#

##8205#1717#Oh god I‚Äôm sore.#

##8214#74187#And if there‚Äôs on#
#8215#4413#e thing Ares Valis #

#8217#1565#First, I experiment#
#8218#52545#ed to find out how #
#8219#26283#steep the grade cou#
#8220#59350#ld be. Piling up so#
#8221#89755#me rocks near the L#
#8222#40357#ander, I dragged it#
#8223#27072# up the pile, then#
#8224#84660#down again. Then I #
#8225#81620#made it steeper, et#
#8226#4302#c. I figured out I #
#8227#57257#could pul it up a 3#
#8228#86723#0 degree grade. Any#
#8229#2593#thing more was too #

#8231#8492# my grip and send t#

##8234#36322#The roof of the rov#

#8240#62969#The first few rocks#

##12070#93818#The ful force of th#

#12072#9674#e rushed through th#

#12074#79644#tenth of a second, #
#12075#93895#the rip was a meter#
#12076#39522# long, running para#

#12078#56050#It propagated al th#

##12084#79366#The unopposed press#

#12105#67736#s shattering into h#
#12106#7768#undreds of smal cub#

#12110#63891#ocking him senseles#
#12111#36270#The airlock tumbled#
#12112#73596# across the surface#
#12113#52971# for a further 15 m#

#12120#40069#arely conscious.
##12121#72472#Finaly done tumblin#

##12125#19849#Watney, on his back#

#12132#76635#Regaining some of h#

#12135#49974#his head to the sid#
#12136#52169#e, he looked throug#
#12137#51581#h the back door‚Äôs#
#12138#58439# window. The colaps#
#12139#4179#Hab rippled in the #

#12142#96501#across the landscap#

##12144#4174#Then, a hissing sou#
#12145#16877#nd reached his ears#
#12146#88291#. Listening careful#
#12147#37374#y, he realized it w#

#12230#1089#Beck‚Äôs suit was a#
#12231#79843#bout the right size#
#12232#72057#didn‚Äôt have a hol#
#12233#56209#e in it. Why does t#
#12234#45272#hat matter right no#
#12235#27706#w? Because, unlike #
#12236#56119#my original suit, t#
#12237#17878#his one stil has an#
#12238#93579# unused patch kit.#
#12239#35153#Don‚Äôt get excited#
#12240#73550#. It won‚Äôt do the#
#12241#24710# suit any good. The#
#12242#60490# patch kit is a con#
#12243#23942#e-shaped valve with#
#12244#65411# super sticky resin#
#12245#2148# on the wide end. I#
#12246#35284#t‚Äôs just too smal#
#12247#15152# to deal with a hol#
#12248#2215#e larger than 8cm. #
#12249#85363#And realy, if you h#
#12250#50957#ave a 9cm hole, you#
#12251#2636#‚Äôre going to be d#
#12252#92735#ead way before you #
#12253#85165#could whip out
##12254#39377#Stil, it‚Äôs an ass#
#12255#30491#et, and maybe I can#
#12256#75832# use it to stop the#
#12257#55982# airlock leak. And #
#12258#41874#that‚Äôs my top pri#
#12259#66519#ority right now.
##12260#56247#It‚Äôs a smal leak.#
#12261#22841# With the faceplate#
#12262#67012# gone, the EVA suit#
#12263#31577# is effectively man#
#12264#42059#aging the whole air#
#12265#16714#lock. It‚Äôs been a#
#12266#46361#dding air to make u#
#12267#32796#p for the missing p#
#12268#56218#ressure. But it‚Äôl#
#12269#41763# run out eventualy.#
#12270#54631#I need to find the #
#12271#24875#leak. I think it‚Äô#
#12272#43808#s near my feet, jud#
#12273#99490#ging by the sound. #
#12274#60781#Now that I‚Äôm out #
#12275#42023#of the suit, I can #
#12276#51029#turn around and get#
#12277#41264#I don‚Äôt see anyth#
#12278#35562#ing‚Ä¶ I can hear i#
#12279#3620#t, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs do#
#12280#6133#wn here somewhere, #
#12281#19693#but I don‚Äôt know #
#12282#56038#I can only think of#
#12283#7943# one way to find it#
#12284#86802#: Start a fire!
##12285#24203#Yeah, I know. A lot#
#12286#54664# of my ideas involv#
#12287#20953#e setting something#
#12288#46288# on fire. And yes, #
#12289#16859#deliberately starti#
#12290#19156#ng a fire in a tiny#
#12291#56802#, enclosed space is#
#12292#56451# usualy a terrible #
#12293#4579#idea. But I need th#
#12294#87259#e smoke. Just a lit#
#12295#2338#tle wisp of it.
##12296#44887#As usual, I‚Äôm wor#
#12297#62239#king with stuff tha#
#12298#90872#t was deliberately #
#12299#29533#designed not to bur#
#12300#36240#n. But no amount of#
#12301#68164# careful design by #
#12302#19167#NASA can get around#
#12303#5729#a determined arsoni#
#12304#42264#st with a tank of p#
#12305#5230#The EVA suit is mad#
#12306#97824#e entirely of non-f#
#12307#47958#lammable materials.#
#12308#92803# So is the airlock.#
#12309#62641# My clothes are fir#
#12310#77090#eproof as wel, even#
#12311#89807#I was originaly pla#
#12312#3363#nning to check the #
#12313#55606#solar array, doing #
#12314#38580#repairs as needed a#
#12315#4614#fter last night‚Äôs#
#12316#71579# storm. So I have m#
#12317#82076#y toolbox with me. #
#12318#94599#looking through it,#
#12319#88907# it‚Äôs al metal or#
#12320#43099# non-flammable plas#
#12321#98283#I just realized I d#
#12322#88873#o have something fl#
#12323#11550#ammable: My own hai#
#12324#31484#r. It‚Äôl have to d#
#12325#78091#o. There‚Äôs a shar#
#12326#88227#p knife in the tool#
#12327#63255#-kit. I‚Äôl shave s#
#12328#36296#hairs off into a li#
#12329#18529#Next step: oxygen. #
#12330#36704#Back when I turned #
#12331#66048#the hydrazine into #
#12332#28625#water, I had tubing#
#12333#15382#, garbage bags, and#
#12334#68634# al sorts of other #

#12336#14778#have anything so re#
#12337#85360#fined is a pure oxy#
#12338#53669#gen flow. Al I can #
#12339#1680#do is muck with the#
#12340#20158# EVA suit controls #
#12341#26431#to increase oxygen #
#12342#80373#percentage in the w#
#12343#16327#hole airlock. I fig#
#12344#41251#ure bumping it to 4#
#12345#24249#Al I need now is a #
#12346#7056#The EVA suit has el#
#12347#2590#ectronics, but it r#
#12348#71126#uns on very low vol#
#12349#91610#tage. I don‚Äôt thi#
#12350#38614#nk I could get an a#
#12351#84198#rc with it. Besides#
#12352#59125#, I don‚Äôt want to#
#12353#89749# tear up my suit‚Äô#

#12357#27717#The airlock itself #

#12375#22908#Fun fact: This is e#

#12378#55558#AUDIO LOG: SOL 119#
#12379#19560#I‚Äôm in a box ful #
#12380#13550#of burning hair sme#
#12381#14416#l. It‚Äôs not a goo#
#12382#20041#On my first try, th#
#12383#98797#e fire lit, but the#
#12384#73831# smoke just drifted#
#12385#75715# randomly around. M#
#12386#48464#y own breathing was#
#12387#75167# screwing it up. So#
#12388#29647# I held my breath a#
#12389#22418#My second try, the #
#12390#31673#EVA suit threw ever#
#12391#76401#ything off. There‚Ä#
#12392#83264#ôs a gentle flow of#
#12393#34889# air coming out of #
#12394#8191#the faceplate as th#
#12395#62678#e suit constantly r#
#12396#82151#eplaces the missing#
#12397#14704# air. So I shut the#
#12398#84519# suit down, held my#
#12399#484# breath, and tried #
#12400#79982#again. I had to be #
#12401#55425#quick; the pressure#
#12402#81374# was dropping.
##12403#32327#My third try, the q#
#12404#33538#uick arm movements #
#12405#74595#I used to set the f#
#12406#16423#ire messed everythi#
#12407#16216#ng up. Just moving #
#12408#24296#around makes enough#
#12409#71213# turbulence to
##12410#21907#send the smoke ever#
#12411#70580#The fourth time I k#
#12412#27338#ept the suit turned#
#12413#22603# off, held my breat#
#12414#31489#h, and when the tim#
#12415#2912#e came to light the#
#12416#48343# fire, I did it ver#
#12417#56269#y slowly. Then I wa#
#12418#21633#tched as the little#
#12419#57091# wisp of smoke drif#
#12420#76045#ted toward the floo#
#12421#36734#r of the airlock, d#
#12422#99034#isappearing through#
#12423#41211# a hairline fractur#
#12424#36760#I have you now, lit#
#12425#72170#I gasped for air an#
#12426#62669#d turned the EVA su#
#12427#95430#it back on. The pre#
#12428#60739#ssure had dropped t#
#12429#18217#o 0.9 atmospheres d#
#12430#73825#uring my little exp#
#12431#20052#eriment. But there#
#12432#95819#was plenty of oxyge#
#12433#68238#n in the air for me#
#12434#13974# any my hair-fire t#
#12435#88976#o breathe. The suit#
#12436#73367# quickly got things#
#12437#15192# back to normal.
##12438#11366#Looking at the frac#
#12439#28437#ture, it‚Äôs pretty#
#12440#85181# tiny. It would be #
#12441#39498#a cinch to seal it #
#12442#76062#with the suit‚Äôs p#
#12443#54209#atch kit, but now t#
#12444#69313#hat I think about i#
#12445#45383#t, that‚Äôs a bad i#
#12446#93557#I‚Äôl need to do so#
#12447#81660#me kind of repair t#
#12448#90813#o the faceplate. I #
#12449#39533#don‚Äôt know how ju#
#12450#7932#st yet, but the pat#
#12451#11160#ch kit and its pres#
#12452#70573#sure-resistant resi#
#12453#70053#probably realy impo#
#12454#15460#rtant. And I can‚Äô#
#12455#46417#t do it bit by bit,#
#12456#15450# either. Once I bre#
#12457#64843#ak the seal on the #
#12458#37195#patch kit, the bina#
#12459#44666#ry components of th#
#12460#7832#e resin mix and I h#
#12461#66000#ave 60 seconds befo#
#12462#88189#re it hardens. I ca#
#12463#23469#n‚Äôt just take a l#
#12464#30262#ittle to fix the cr#
#12465#142#Given time, I might#
#12466#7865# be able to come up#
#12467#35846# with a plan for th#
#12468#70359#e faceplate. Then, #
#12469#76729#I could take a few #
#12470#37094#seconds during that#
#12471#2813# plan to scrape res#
#12472#41766#over the airlock fr#
#12473#76760#acture. But I don‚Ä#
#12474#19413#I‚Äôm down to 40% o#
#12475#1822#f my N2 tank. I nee#
#12476#44180#d to seal that frac#
#12477#44986#ture now, and I nee#
#12478#48186#d to do it without #
#12479#27724#using the patch kit#
#12480#47811#First idea: Little #
#12481#49347#Dutch Boy. I‚Äôm li#
#12482#55521#cking my palm and p#
#12483#50466#lacing it over the #
#12484#23797#Ok‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt qui#
#12485#28051#te make a perfect s#
#12486#83045#eal, so there‚Äôs a#
#12487#46139#irflow‚Ä¶ getting c#
#12488#14873#older now‚Ä¶ gettin#
#12489#20125#g pretty uncomforta#
#12490#77030#ble‚Ä¶ ok fuck this#
#12491#77884#On to idea number t#
#12492#22474#I have duct tape in#
#12493#69932# my tool box. Let‚Ä#
#12494#7678#ôs slap some on and#
#12495#65461# see if it slows th#
#12496#58227#e flow. I wonder ho#
#12497#27517#w long it wil last #
#12498#32706#before the pressure#
#12499#72332# rips it. Putting i#
#12500#5178#There we go‚Ä¶ stil#
#12501#50098#Lemme check the sui#
#12502#47600#t‚Ä¶ Readouts say t#
#12503#29387#he pressure is stab#
#12504#35489#le. Looks like the #
#12505#13111#duct tape made a go#
#12506#20516#Let‚Äôs see if it h#
#12507#50082#AUDIO LOG: SOL 119#
#12508#30218#It‚Äôs been 15 minu#
#12509#30002#tes, and the tape i#
#12510#66727#s stil holding. Loo#
#12511#9738#ks like that proble#
#12512#26625#Sort of anticlimact#
#12513#87758#ic, realy. I was al#
#12514#15239#ready working out h#
#12515#32187#ow to cover the bre#

#12518#94875# in the EVA suit‚Äô#
#12519#3251#‚Äúhamster-feeder‚Ä#

#12528#20578#Al right. On to my #
#12529#93286#next problem: How d#
#12530#66976#o I fix the EVA sui#
#12531#88938#t? Duct tape might #
#12532#40463#seal a hairline cra#
#12533#84580#ck, but it can‚Äôt #
#12534#33721#hold an atmosphere #
#12535#98406#pressure against th#
#12536#53249#e size of my broken#
#12537#9192#The patch kit is to#
#12538#32367#o smal, but stil us#
#12539#79943#eful. I can spread #
#12540#21161#the resin around th#
#12541#88577#e edge of where the#
#12542#4146# faceplate was, the#
#12543#29742#n stick something o#
#12544#14589#n to cover the hole#
#12545#76893#. Problem is, what #
#12546#81206#do I use to cover t#
#12547#74423#he hole? Something #
#12548#28820#that can stand up t#
#12549#73359#o a lot of pressure#
#12550#79538#Looking around, the#
#12551#81915# only thing I see t#
#12552#78463#hat can hold an atm#
#12553#42451#osphere is the EVA #
#12554#49459#suit itself. There‚#

#12571#46447# I‚Äôm going to cut#
#12572#801#Wel, no. Not my arm#

#13005#22502#one arm to work wit#

#13007#46337#pinned against my
##13008#81552#body, while the stu#
#13009#61524#mpy arm of the suit#
#13010#73982# bounced freely. So#
#13011#59777# as I moved around #
#13012#28626#under the canvas, I#
#13013#92652# had to use my one #

#13016#50007#From what I could s#

#13019#66109#Everything‚Äôs move#

#13047#80976#Running low on time#

#16993#28521#sly, Mark? Seriousl#
#16994#87785#First, I depressuri#
#16995#81182#zed the trailer. Ca#
#16996#60570#l me crazy, but I d#
#16997#42081#idn't want the dril#
#16998#51899# explosively launch#
#16999#13888#ed at my face.
##17000#10424#Then I had to pick #
#17001#71978#somewhere to start.#
#17002#14419# I thought it'd be #
#17003#29739#easiest to start on#
#17004#29165# the side. I was wr#
#17005#35883#The roof would have#
#17006#91474# been better. The s#
#17007#33861#ide was a hassle be#
#17008#84538#cause I had to hold#
#17009#41588# the dril paralel t#
#17010#31905#o the ground. This #
#17011#74093#isn't your dad's
##17012#77435#Black & Decker we'r#
#17013#81867#e talking about. It#
#17014#30975#'s a meter long and#
#17015#27614# only safe to hold #
#17016#26450#by the handles.
##17017#36039#Getting it to bite #
#17018#61761#was nasty. I presse#
#17019#77051#d it against the hu#
#17020#81608#l and turned it on,#
#17021#98418# but it wandered al#
#17022#88646# over the place. So#
#17023#82096# I got my trusty ha#
#17024#11013#mmer and screwdrive#
#17025#61860#r. With a few taps,#
#17026#62807# I made a smal chip#
#17027#51746# in the carbon comp#
#17028#68480#That gave the bit a#
#17029#2280# place to seat, so #
#17030#62073#I could keep drilin#
#17031#57207#g in one place. As #
#17032#62190#NASA predicted, it #
#17033#78449#took about two minu#
#17034#75376#tes to get al the w#
#17035#63935#I folowed the same #
#17036#84787#procedure for the s#
#17037#46419#econd hole and it w#
#17038#10984#ent much smoother. #
#17039#79321#After the third hol#
#17040#68551#e, the dril's overh#
#17041#64915#eat light came on.#
#17042#93487#It wasn't designed #
#17043#20657#to operate constant#
#17044#99331#ly for so long. For#
#17045#77774#tunately, it sensed#
#17046#85536# the overheat and w#
#17047#82632#arned me. So I lean#
#17048#60932#ed it against the
##17049#20735#workbench for a few#
#17050#32933# minutes and it coo#
#17051#9645#led down. One thing#
#17052#63375# you can say about #
#17053#23857#Mars: It's really c#
#17054#931#old. The thin atmos#

#19771#20810#g my smalest dril b#

#20457#53357#It was so much easi#
#20458#36400#er without the EVA #

#20460#9025#Then I had to test #

##20496#95271#I roled up the whol#

#21662#30170#gulate their own te#
#21663#99493#mperatures just fin#
#21664#35000#e, but things weren#
#21665#54938#'t hot enough in th#
#21666#71623#Story of my life.
##21667#74025#The rover has an el#
#21668#55477#ectric heater that #
#21669#89610#pushes air with a s#
#21670#8764#mal fan. I don't us#
#21671#64636#e it for anything b#
#21672#76199#ecause the RTG prov#
#21673#83421#ides al the heat I #
#21674#63559#I liberated the fan#
#21675#65417# and wired it in to#
#21676#34293# a power line near #
#21677#84798#the airlock. Once i#
#21678#39706#t had power al I ha#
#21679#54715#d to do was point i#
#21680#21022#t at the bedroom.
##21681#73682#It's a low-tech sol#
#21682#23654#ution, but it worke#
#21683#82548#d. There's plenty o#
#21684#85472#f heat, thanks to t#
#21685#98156#he RTG. I just need#
#21686#70666#ed to get it evenly#
#21687#29619# spread out. For on#
#21688#46210#ce, entropy was on #
#21689#52039#I fel in to a routi#
#21690#1206#ne pretty quickly. #
#21691#88261#In fact, it was hau#
#21692#86951#ntingly familiar. I#
#21693#16315# did it for 22 mise#
#21694#73702#rable days on the P#
#21695#1363#athfinder trip. But#
#21696#29739# this time, I had t#
#21697#3722#he bedroom and that#
#21698#71808# makes al the diffe#
#21699#65229#rence. Instead of b#
#21700#91132#eing cooped up in t#
#21701#51517#he rover, I have my#
#21702#58881# own little Hab.
##21703#25016#The procedure is wh#
#21704#26880#at you'd expect. Af#
#21705#31212#ter waking up, I ha#
#21706#43567#ve a potato for bre#
#21707#79938#akfast. Then, I def#
#21708#8884#late the bedroom fr#
#21709#57175#om the inside. It's#
#21710#16339#kind of tricky, but#
#21711#77310# I worked out how.#
#21712#82640#First, I put on an #
#21713#32176#EVA suit. Then I cl#
#21714#6#ose the inner airlo#
#21715#28082#ck door, leaving th#
#21716#93494#e outer door (which#
#21717#69289# the bedroom is att#
#21718#9792#ached to) open. Thi#
#21719#73818#isolates the bedroo#
#21720#20417#m, with me in it, f#
#21721#81111#rom the rest of the#
#21722#40855# rover. Then I tel #
#21723#10855#the airlock to depr#
#21724#90007#essurize. It thinks#
#21725#48677# it's just pumping #
#21726#75625#the air out of a sm#
#21727#68777#al area, but it's a#
#21728#39724#ctualy deflating th#
#21729#29067#e whole bedroom.
##21730#31062#Once the pressure i#
#21731#63573#s gone, I pul the c#
#21732#85804#anvas in and fold i#
#21733#76931#t. Then I detach it#
#21734#59871# from the outer hat#
#21735#48621#ch and close the ou#
#21736#72131#ter door. This is t#
#21737#60625#most cramped part. #
#21738#7134#I have to share the#
#21739#79077# airlock with the e#
#21740#72214#ntire folded up bed#
#21741#36193#room while it repre#
#21742#70094#ssurizes. Once I ha#
#21743#22458#ve pressure again, #
#21744#22276#I open the inner do#
#21745#82252#or and more-or-less#
#21746#41378# fal in to the rove#
#21747#94247#r. Then I stow the #
#21748#95039#bedroom, and go bac#
#21749#55483#k to the airlock fo#
#21750#38280#r a normal egress t#
#21751#67903#It's a complicated #
#21752#50188#process, but it det#
#21753#56102#aches the bedroom w#
#21754#32712#ithout having to de#
#21755#87169#pressurize the rove#
#21756#79286#r cabin. Remember, #
#21757#69119#the rover has al my#
#21758#44684#stuff that doesn't #
#21759#91902#play wel with vacuu#
#21760#59454#The next step is to#
#21761#53003# gather up the sola#
#21762#52684#r cels I'd laid out#
#21763#60718# the day before and#
#21764#51132# stow them on the r#
#21765#51690#over and trailer. T#
#21766#36657#hen I do a quick ch#
#21767#32528#eck on the trailer.#
#21768#80826# I go in through it#
#21769#93225#s airlock and basic#
#21770#40161#aly take a quick lo#
#21771#34818#ok at al the equipm#
#21772#36460#ent. I don't even t#
#21773#1531#ake off my EVA suit#
#21774#11866#. I just want to ma#
#21775#80809#ke sure nothing's o#
#21776#16644#bviously wrong.
##21777#88504#Then, back to the r#
#21778#13766#over. Once inside, #
#21779#49755#I take off the EVA #
#21780#98128#suit and start driv#
#21781#70663#ing. I drive for al#
#21782#37392#most 4 hours, and t#
#21783#70687#hen I'm out of powe#
#21784#8173#Once I park, it's b#
#21785#48109#ack in to the EVA s#
#21786#60658#uit for me, and out#
#21787#486# to Mars again. I l#
#21788#19568#ay the solar panels#
#21789#94615# out and get the ba#
#21790#28155#tteries charging.
##21791#2754#Then I set up the b#
#21792#25588#edroom. Pretty much#
#21793#30479# the reverse of the#
#21794#89537# sequence I use to #
#21795#36956#stow it. Ultimately#
#21796#98032# it's the airlock t#
#21797#71506#hat inflates it. In#
#21798#43514# a way, the bedroom#
#21799#86347# is just an extensi#
#21800#6106#on of the airlock.#
#21801#32726#Even though it's po#
#21802#50088#ssible, I don't rap#
#21803#63883#id-inflate the bedr#
#21804#51581#oom. I did that to #
#21805#17443#test it because I w#
#21806#50274#anted to find where#
#21807#24535# it'l leak. But it'#
#21808#44160#s not a good idea. #
#21809#47920#Rapid inflation put#
#21810#67953#s a lot of shock an#
#21811#54066#d pressure on it. I#
#21812#25200#t would eventualy r#
#21813#34114#upture. I didn't en#
#21814#67766#joy that time the H#
#21815#53106#ab launched me like#
#21816#87621# a cannonbal. I'm n#
#21817#56990#ot eager to repeat #
#21818#35396#Once the bedroom is#
#21819#23718# set up again, I ca#
#21820#12076#n take off my EVA s#
#21821#83066#uit and relax the r#
#21822#77710#est of the day. I m#

#22172#79849#Another uneventful #

#22175#72942#s kind of my Friday#
#22176#35423#I'm about half-way #
#22177#53143#through Mawrth Vali#
#22178#35589#s now. Just as I'd #
#22179#75247#hoped, the going ha#
#22180#7357#s been easy. No maj#
#22181#63633#or elevation change#
#22182#55033#obstacles. Just smo#
#22183#13807#oth sand with rocks#
#22184#41078# smaler than half a#
#22185#51086#You may be wonderin#
#22186#75558#g how I navigate. W#
#22187#95811#hen I went to Pathf#
#22188#92089#inder, I watched Ph#
#22189#19810#obos transit the sk#
#22190#43253#y to figure out the#
#22191#79768# east-west axis.
##22192#15012#But Pathfinder was #
#22193#42472#an easy trip compar#
#22194#80521#ed to this, and I d#
#22195#82306#id it mostly with l#
#22196#16466#I can't get away wi#
#22197#9449#th that this time. #
#22198#96169#My ‚Äúmap‚Äù (such #
#22199#7221#as it is) consists #
#22200#36510#of satelite images #
#22201#94406#far too low-resolut#
#22202#43309#ion to be of any us#
#22203#83827#e. They just never #
#22204#65156#expected me to be o#
#22205#49236#ut this far. The on#
#22206#12741#ly reason I had hig#
#22207#3437#h-res images of the#
#22208#78268# Pathfinder region #
#22209#11059#is because they wer#
#22210#79980#e included for land#
#22211#79371#ing purposes; in ca#
#22212#55657#se Martinez had to #
#22213#650#land way long of ou#
#22214#44781#So this time around#
#22215#5425#, I needed a reliab#
#22216#98884#le way to fix my po#
#22217#26064#sition on Mars.
##22218#22753#Latitude and Longit#
#22219#26647#ude. That's the key#
#22220#46233#. The first is easy#
#22221#29022#. Ancient sailors o#
#22222#21241#n Earth figured tha#
#22223#19432#t one out right awa#
#22224#94721#y. Earth's 23.5 deg#
#22225#7355#ree axis points at #
#22226#40209#Polaris. Mars has a#
#22227#3853# tilt of just over #
#22228#91899#25 degrees, so it's#
#22229#47693# pointed at Deneb.#
#22230#45079#Making a sextant is#
#22231#50677#n't hard. Al you ne#
#22232#85654#ed is a tube to loo#
#22233#35212#k through, a string#
#22234#2985#, a weight, and som#
#22235#45373#ething with degree #
#22236#54096#markings. I made it#
#22237#24546# in under an hour.#
#22238#23208#So I go out every n#
#22239#23902#ight with a home-ma#
#22240#74470#de sextant and sigh#
#22241#8983#t Deneb. It's kind #
#22242#34336#of sily if you thin#
#22243#26897#k about it. I'm in #
#22244#33692#my space suit on Ma#
#22245#95620#and I'm navigating #
#22246#60413#with 16th century t#
#22247#55439#ools. But hey, they#
#22248#39391#Longitude is a diff#
#22249#87179#erent matter. On Ea#
#22250#68863#rth, the earliest w#
#22251#7947#ay to work out long#
#22252#23301#itude required them#
#22253#31000# to know the exact #
#22254#92824#time, then compare #
#22255#80790#to the sun's positi#
#22256#2512#on in the sky. The #
#22257#14677#hard part for them #
#22258#18962#back then was inven#
#22259#95788#ting a clock that w#
#22260#32517#ould work on a boat#
#22261#64130# (pendulums don't w#
#22262#86762#ork on boats). Al t#
#22263#55349#he top scientific m#
#22264#42924#inds of the age wor#
#22265#1233#ked on the problem.#
#22266#7786#Fortunately, I have#
#22267#51099# accurate clocks. T#
#22268#74378#here are four compu#
#22269#77596#ters in my immediat#
#22270#69707#e line of sight rig#
#22271#67200#ht now. And I have #
#22272#64512#Because Phobos is r#
#22273#41772#idiculously close t#
#22274#56156#o Mars, it orbits t#
#22275#68833#he planet in less t#
#22276#61672#han one Martian day#
#22277#97955#. So it travels wes#
#22278#68884#t to east (unlike t#
#22279#90939#he sun and Deimos) #
#22280#28537#and sets every 11 h#
#22281#39949#ours. And naturaly,#
#22282#17706# it moves in a very#
#22283#83762# predictable patter#
#22284#5852#I spend 13 hours ev#
#22285#91991#ery sol just sittin#
#22286#36097#g around while the #
#22287#80483#solar panels charge#
#22288#90125# the batteries. Pho#
#22289#16788#bos is guaranteed t#
#22290#76167#o set at least once#
#22291#51306#during that time. I#
#22292#18585# note the time when#
#22293#2626# it does. Then I pl#
#22294#35269#ug it in to a nasty#
#22295#31983# formula I worked o#
#22296#18442#ut and I know my lo#
#22297#16482#So, working out lon#

#23783#54365#The trailer has ton#

#23787#29029#pen. The baloon giv#

#23789#32983#om. Not a lot of fl#
#23790#29563#oor space, but stil#
#23791#22956# lots of vertical a#
#23792#66173#Also, the bedroom h#
#23793#14215#as several valve ap#

#23795#5970#as. I have the pop-#

#24341#17580#get the weight off #
#24342#36590#the baloon. Next, I#
#24343#69820# need to right the #

#24394#98090#I had a busy day to#
#24395#81775#day and I got a lot#
#24396#88668#I started out prett#
#24397#38388#y sore. I had to sl#
#24398#40409#eep on the wal of t#
#24399#22166#he rover. The bedro#
#24400#52444#om won't work when #
#24401#36358#the airlock is faci#
#24402#60022#ng up. I did get to#
#24403#71772# use the bedroom, s#
#24404#56043#omewhat. I folded i#
#24405#93153#t up and used it as#
#24406#61579#Anyway, suffice to #
#24407#85150#say the wal of the #
#24408#41781#rover wasn't made f#
#24409#87299#or sleeping on. But#
#24410#75876# after a morning po#
#24411#86257#tato and Vicodin, I#
#24412#58099# was feeling much
##24413#31886#At first I figured #
#24414#12617#my top priority was#
#24415#21330# the trailer. Then #
#24416#12010#I changed my mind. #
#24417#24340#After taking a good#
#24418#61600# look at it, I deci#
#24419#6835#ded I'd never be ab#
#24420#5712#le to right it by m#
#24421#85307#yself. I'd need the#
#24422#24995#So today was focuse#
#24423#58820#d on getting the ro#
#24424#68088#I brought al my too#
#24425#23000#ls along on this tr#
#24426#31545#ip, figuring I'd ne#
#24427#41213#ed them for the MAV#
#24428#66607# modifications. And#
#24429#20856# along with them I #
#24430#43504#brought cabling. On#
#24431#76990#I get set up at the#
#24432#16226# MAV, my solar cels#
#24433#43900# and batteries wil #
#24434#30147#be in a fixed posit#
#24435#11822#ion. I don't want t#
#24436#99780#o move the rover ar#
#24437#19502#ound every time I u#
#24438#291#se a dril on the fa#
#24439#7904#r side of the MAV. #
#24440#40793#So I brought al the#
#24441#61400# electrical cabling#
#24442#89218#Good thing, too. Be#
#24443#78334#cause it doubles as#
#24444#92066#I dug up my longest#
#24445#67753# cable. It's the sa#
#24446#57728#me one I used to po#
#24447#7437#wer the dril that d#
#24448#78778#estroyed Pathfinder#
#24449#51781#. I cal it my ‚ÄúLu#
#24450#34777#I plugged one end i#
#24451#61136#n to the battery an#
#24452#93437#d the other in to t#
#24453#92037#he infamous sample #
#24454#91665#dril. Then walked o#
#24455#11163#ff with the dril to#
#24456#63549# find solid ground.#
#24457#21149#Once I found it, I #
#24458#91530#kept going until I'#
#24459#41296#d gone as far as th#
#24460#31378#e electrical line w#
#24461#51870#ould reach. I drove#
#24462#70145# a 1-meter bit half#
#24463#79413# a meter into a roc#
#24464#43349#k, unplugged the po#
#24465#90552#wer line, and tied #
#24466#27501#it around the base #
#24467#45388#Then I went back to#
#24468#65031# the rover and tied#
#24469#63722# off the cord to th#
#24470#53718#e roof-rack bar on #
#24471#21858#the high side. Now #
#24472#63802#I had a long, taut #
#24473#2739#perpendicular to th#
#24474#75195#I walked to the mid#
#24475#55280#dle of the cord and#
#24476#53085# puled it lateraly.#
#24477#28383# The leverage advan#
#24478#82810#tage on the rover w#
#24479#4858#as huge. I only hop#
#24480#55342#ed it wouldn't brea#
#24481#20638#the dril bit before#
#24482#79803# it tipped the rove#
#24483#52838#I backed away, puli#
#24484#19803#ng the line more an#
#24485#34234#d more. Something h#
#24486#7799#ad to give, and it #
#24487#7141#wasn't going to be #
#24488#15452#me. I had Archimede#
#24489#26933#s on my side. The
##24490#53915#rover finaly tipped#
#24491#46276#It fel on to its wh#
#24492#5715#eels, kicking up a #
#24493#79288#large cloud of soft#
#24494#98808# dust. It was a sil#
#24495#14686#ent affair. I was f#
#24496#12261#ar enough away that#
#24497#86051# the thin atmospher#
#24498#34055#e had no hope of ca#
#24499#53251#rrying the sound to#
#24500#71802#I untied the power #
#24501#27380#line, liberated the#
#24502#43579# dril bit, and retu#
#24503#67554#rned to the rover. #
#24504#77105#I gave it a ful sys#
#24505#98735#tem's check. That's#
#24506#9404# a boring-as-hel ta#
#24507#87077#sk but I had to do #
#24508#36023#it. Every system an#
#24509#19998#d subsystem was wor#
#24510#66864#king correctly.
##24511#21687#JPL did a damn good#
#24512#2712# job making these r#
#24513#87542#overs. If I get bac#
#24514#62979#k to Earth, I'm buy#
#24515#6978#ing Bruce Ng a beer#
#24516#44632#. Though I guess I #
#24517#30735#should buy al the
##24518#1583#JPL guys a beer.
##24519#96298#Beers for fucking e#
#24520#25481#veryone if I get ba#
#24521#42412#Anyway, with the ro#
#24522#56397#ver back on its whe#
#24523#82710#els it was time to #
#24524#95855#work on the trailer#
#24525#76308#. Problem is, I'm i#
#24526#70096#I had gotten most o#
#24527#74549#f the way down the #
#24528#22085#Ramp when I roled t#
#24529#25928#he rover. And the R#
#24530#35589#amp is up against t#
#24531#36199#he western edge of #
#24532#83616#the crater. So
##24533#1136#the sun sets realy #
#24534#97928#early from my point#
#24535#96591# of view. I'm in th#
#24536#8820#e shadow of the wes#
#24537#91000#tern wal. And that #
#24538#68493#Mars is not Earth. #
#24539#90342#It doesn't have a t#
#24540#92770#hick atmosphere to #
#24541#59772#bend light and carr#
#24542#80998#y particles that re#
#24543#52026#flect light around #
#24544#45469#corners. It's damn-#
#24545#4500#near a vacuum here.#
#24546#27212# Once the sun isn't#
#24547#93984# visible, I'm in th#

#24554#59090#Long story short: I#
#24555#29872# ran out of dayligh#
#24556#5346#t. I hate to leave #
#24557#31078#the trailer sitting#
#24558#73022# on its baloon for #
#24559#22131#another night, but #
#24560#77411#there's not much el#

#24562#35#re it's survived a #
#24563#48156#whole day like that#
#24564#37710#. It's probably sta#
#24565#78640#And hey, with the r#
#24566#2210#over righted, I get#

#24570#51395#LOG ENTRY: SOL 500#
#24571#36648#When I woke up this#
#24572#633# morning, the trail#
#24573#75789#er hadn't popped ye#
#24574#83535#t. So that was a go#
#24575#24851#The trailer was a b#
#24576#57256#igger chalenge than#
#24577#14627# the rover. I only #
#24578#16047#had to tip the rove#
#24579#14017#r. I'd need to comp#
#24580#39671#letely flip the tra#
#24581#33080#iler. That requires#
#24582#32974# lot more force tha#
#24583#57474#n yesterday's littl#
#24584#75533#e leverage trick.
##24585#43458#The first step was #
#24586#523#to drive the rover #
#24587#32725#to near the trailer#
#24588#96889#. Then came the dig#
#24589#23868#Oh god the digging.#
#24590#39139#The trailer was ups#
#24591#74075#ide down with its n#
#24592#38529#ose pointed downhil#
#24593#70039#. I decided the bes#
#24594#67838#t way to right it w#
#24595#24687#as to take advantag#
#24596#93066#e of the slope and#
#24597#82095#rol the trailer ove#
#24598#20601#r its nose. Basical#
#24599#1063#y to make it do a s#
#24600#61808#omersault to land o#
#24601#72119#I can make this hap#
#24602#73684#pen by tying off th#
#24603#96192#e cable to the rear#
#24604#29711# of the trailer and#
#24605#67350# towing with the ro#
#24606#85132#ver. But if I tried#
#24607#81597# that without diggi#
#24608#62832#ng a hole first, th#
#24609#78239#e trailer would jus#
#24610#52046#t slide along the g#
#24611#54531#round. I needed it #
#24612#77045#to tip up. I needed#
#24613#87505# a hole for the nos#
#24614#76197#e to fal in to.
##24615#26484#So I dug a hole. A #
#24616#82146#hole one by three m#
#24617#16689#eters, and one mete#
#24618#19800#r deep. It took me #
#24619#42756#four miserable hour#
#24620#49293#s of hard labor, bu#
#24621#34713#t I got it done.
##24622#84236#I hopped in the rov#
#24623#58088#er and drove it dow#
#24624#84299#nhil, dragging the #
#24625#94090#trailer with me. As#
#24626#55605# I'd hoped, the tra#
#24627#97810#iler nosed in to th#
#24628#1600#e hole and tipped u#

#24630#6587#on to its wheels wi#

#24678#50873#oticed was that it #

#24726#61744#rned upside down. T#

#24729#81930#f puddled water tha#

#24731#78259#hile to sop up with#

#24733#90785#ped the tank off wi#

##24743#79529#That's my heating s#
#24744#99405#But al things consi#
#24745#8627#dered, it was good #
#24746#58414#news. The critical #
#24747#9224#components are work#
#24748#31961#ing fine, and both #
#24749#91697#vehicles are back o#
#24750#80783#n their tires.
##24751#12052#The hoses that conn#
#24752#44627#ected the rover and#
#24753#21705# trailer were desig#
#24754#90167#ned wel, and releas#
#24755#47504#ed without breaking#
#24756#77654#. I simply snapped #
#24757#74051#them back in to
##24758#61953#place and the vehic#
#24759#35500#les were sharing li#
#24760#47744#fe support again.
##24761#64775#The one remaining t#
#24762#63718#hing to fix was the#
#24763#8877# tow hook. It was a#
#24764#6713#bsolutely ruined. I#
#24765#88750#t took the ful forc#
#24766#92786#e of the crash. As #
#24767#13119#I suspected, the tr#
#24768#44279#ailer's tow hook wa#
#24769#95964#s unscathed. So I t#
#24770#65151#ransferred it to th#
#24771#68388#e rover and reconne#
#24772#65872#cted the two vehicl#
#24773#92048#es for travel.
##24774#28724#Al told, that littl#

#24782#69682#ight not get off so#
#24783#71333# easy. I think this#
#24784#84577# was sort of a frea#
#24785#81111#accident. The probl#
#24786#59821#em was that one whe#

#24793#33666#. At least for the #
#24794#36669#duration of my time#
#24795#20930# on The Ramp. Once #

#25293#68233#‚ÄúFirstly, we're g#

#25295#2649#he MAV makes its ow#

#25302#75345#g of fuel, as it wa#
#25303#14935#s designed to do. I#
#25304#62400#f we can give it mo#

#25332#56539#‚ÄúIt buys us 300kg#
#25333#82372# of payload. It's a#
#25334#66083#l about fuel versus#

#25336#33483# launch weight is o#
#25337#87121#ver 12,600kg. We ne#
#25338#14177#ed to get that down#
#25339#68211#to 7,300kg. That's #
#25340#89916#accounting for the #
#25341#74664#bonus fuel. So the #
#25342#17212#rest of this bookle#

#25647#24580#an take advantage o#

#25974#47602#But NASA thought ev#
#25975#59216#erything through an#
#25976#2613#d gave me a process#
#25977#90208#. First, I disconne#
#25978#66225#cted the rover and #
#25979#60166#trailer from each o#
#25980#8975#ther. Then, while
##25981#53403#wearing my EVA suit#
#25982#23288#, I depressurized t#
#25983#43091#he trailer and back#
#25984#20885#-filed it with pure#
#25985#13087# oxygen at one four#
#25986#76957#th of an atmosphere#
#25987#64611#. Then I opened a
##25988#42360#plastic box ful of #
#25989#68381#urine and put a cou#
#25990#46374#ple of electrodes i#
#25991#19588#n. That's why I nee#
#25992#87562#ded the atmosphere.#
#25993#94895# Without it, the ur#
#25994#83505#ine would just boil#
#25995#59921#immediately and I'd#
#25996#74908# be hanging around #
#25997#16890#in an piss-based at#
#25998#6289#The electrolysis se#
#25999#58239#parated the hydroge#
#26000#74254#n and oxygen from e#
#26001#14102#ach other. Over tim#
#26002#45504#e, it reduced the u#
#26003#44629#rine to a realy gro#
#26004#43935#ss sludge as it pul#
#26005#94178#the water out. Now #
#26006#56960#the trailer was ful#
#26007#39297# of even more oxyge#
#26008#56267#n and also hydrogen#
#26009#31013#. Pretty dangerous,#
#26010#5605#Then I fired up the#
#26011#48605# Atmospheric Regula#
#26012#36964#tor. It doesn't eve#
#26013#27766#n recognize hydroge#
#26014#41830#n, but it knows how#
#26015#3132# to yank oxygen out#
#26016#90035# of the air. I brok#
#26017#67296#al the safeties and#
#26018#28652# set it to pul 100%#
#26019#23404# of the oxygen out.#
#26020#57640# After it was done,#
#26021#79249# al that was left w#
#26022#64053#as hydrogen. That's#
#26023#91826# why I started out #
#26024#85443#with an atmosphere #
#26025#76445#of pure oxygen. So #
#26026#46479#the regulator could#
#26027#20619# separate it later.#
#26028#23250#Then I opened the i#
#26029#59400#nner airlock door a#
#26030#34391#nd had it evacuate #
#26031#97517#the trailer. It pum#
#26032#12471#ped al the air in t#
#26033#76318#o the airlock's hol#
#26034#25795#ding tank. And ther#
#26035#46414#e you have it, a ta#
#26036#33658#nk of pure hydrogen#
#26037#14388#The final step was #
