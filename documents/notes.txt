Use PySerial to communicate with node

use RF12 demo app for node configuration (permanent in flash memmory) later this can be used by sketch, or sketch can set up its own values
    uint8_t rf12_configSilent - loads node id, frequency and other setting from flash
    void rf12_configDump - writes current config to serial
    
    maybe more easy way is to implement EEPROM acces on our own - write small app just to upload node id etc over serial to EEPROM, normal app just reads EEPROM and doesn not wait for serial
