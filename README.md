#Edu-hoc project

Edu-hoc project is educational platform for ad-hoc networking with focus on wireless sensor networks ans security of these. It aims to provide easy to use environment for anyone interested, but with minimal experience in the area of ad-hoc network, since these tend to have rather specific approach to problems like routing, encryption etc. 

Project will supply various working examples of code for individual nodes, exercises for practicing various security primitives and on the server side capability to easily manage upload to every node in the network. Also web based interface for monitoring actual status of the network (percentage of delivered messages etc.) and evaluating of individual exercises. 

## Technical details

Project is currently using Arduino compatible hardware for physical realization of network, and ease of use is ensured with use of Bare-Arduino-Project for installation instructions and other issues regarding this part of project please refer to: https://github.com/ladislas/Bare-Arduino-Project
